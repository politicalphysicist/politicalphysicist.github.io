  <note>Sheep graze in fields next to the British Energy Hunterston &apos;B&apos; nuclear power station near Largs in west Scotland September 24, 2008. French utility EDF launched a 12.5 billion pound agreed bid for nuclear operator British Energy, in a revamped offer to take control of Britain&apos;s nuclear power industry. EDF, the world&apos;s biggest maker of nuclear energy, said on Wednesday it was offering 774 pence per British Energy share. It also proposed an alternative of 700 pence in cash plus one nuclear power note, a financial instrument linked to BE&apos;s future performance.  REUTERS/David Moir (BRITAIN)</note>
