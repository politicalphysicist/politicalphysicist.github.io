            <p>The last few months have seen an impressive shift in public discussion
on how to address climate change. Thanks in large part to
newly-elected democratic socialist congresswoman Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez, the concept of a
&#8220;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jxUzp9SZ6-VB-4wSm8sselVMsqWZrSrYpYC9slHKLzo/edit">Green New Deal</a>&#8221;
has come to the fore. This marks a significant move away from previous
policy proposals which have tended to rely on free market mechanisms
such as carbon taxes or (worse) cap-and-trade systems to encourage a
shift away from fossil fuels. Instead, Ocasio-Cortez proposes
government planning and investment to achieve a rapid change in the
American energy system, while providing employment for everyone
willing and able to take it. As big and important a step as this is,
however, we must quickly begin developing detailed proposals and
demands if it is to be
<a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez">more than a slogan</a>. We
must start by stepping back and deciding how much future emission of
greenhouse gases will be deemed acceptable.  We then need to consider
when and for what purposes these emissions will be produced.  This
will require planning at the national, local, and sectoral level. We
also need to think about how mitigating climate change will shape our
future R&amp;D priorities. Finally, we must consider what strategies and
tactics will be required to instigate and see through such a sweeping
economic&nbsp;overhaul.</p>
<h3>Choosing Emissions&nbsp;Limits</h3>
<p>The first thing to be considered for any Green New Deal is what
climate science says regarding how much more greenhouse gas (<span class="caps">GHG</span>) can
be emitted. Of course, any emissions will make climate change that
little bit worse, so what we really mean is what level of emissions is
compatible with the amount of global warming we are willing to
accept. The Paris Agreement commits us to limit warming to 2&deg;C
above pre-industrial temperatures, with some language about aspiring
to keep warming below a 1.5&deg;C rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (<span class="caps">IPCC</span>) does seem to believe the latter goal is
theoretically possible (although some scientists dispute this), but it
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/summary-for-policy-makers/">would require emissions falling by about half by 2030 and reaching a net level of zero by 2050</a>. The
emissions reductions actually pledged in the Paris Agreement, however,
would
<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28663-paris-climate-deal-is-agreed-but-is-it-really-good-enough/">only limit temperature rises to 3&deg;C</a>. All
of this is further complicated by the fact that any statements of what
reductions are needed to achieve a temperature goal are
probabilistic. Because our climate models contain uncertainty, we must
run a large number of subtly different simulations and analyse the
range of results. Scientists will then state what will be required to
have a certain probability of limiting climate change to the desired
level. The upshot of this is that even if we were to cut emissions as
rapidly as described above, there is still a non-negligible chance
that warming would be greater than 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial
levels&#8212;perhaps considerably&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>What this means is that we, as a global society, must choose
the level of warming we consider to be acceptable and how confident we
want to be of limiting warming to that level. At this point you might
be tempted to say that there should be no further warming beyond what
has already occurred and that you want to be as close to certain of
that as possible. However, then we start running into a second
consideration: cost. Decarbonising our society will be an expensive
affair, taking up resources which could have been used for other
things such as non-climate related infrastructure, increased leisure
time, or international development. The faster we
want to achieve it, the more expensive it will be. We thus need to
consider what is the optimal trade-off between sacrifice today and
climatic chaos&nbsp;tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is not simply a matter of people in the Global North trying to
justify inaction. Even if all <span class="caps">GHG</span> emissions ceased tomorrow, a certain
amount of climate change is now inevitable and will require societal
adaptation, particularly in the Global South. Such adaptation means
building massive amounts of new infrastructure and much of this will
be made from steel and concrete. Producing these materials emits
<span class="caps">CO</span><sub>2</sub> due to the chemical reactions involved. Thus, if this
infrastructure is needed before these industries can be decarbonised,
protecting the Global South from existing climate change may mean
making climate change a little bit worse. That is not even to consider
the massive amounts of non-climate infrastructure needed in developing
countries, such as hospitals, decent housing, and reliable&nbsp;electricity.</p>
<p>As can be seen, even the relatively simple task of deciding how much
more <span class="caps">GHG</span> we will allow to be emitted involves very difficult and
inherently political questions. The issue of which countries are
allowed to produce the emissions is even more fraught. Those of us on
the Left would, I hope, agree that developed countries such as the <span class="caps">UK</span>
must take the lead in decarbonising, with much more aggressive
time-tables than their developing counterparts. In the absence of a
global body able to come to and enforce decisions along these lines,
it will be necessary for us as socialists and internationalists to
make this case domestically when emissions targets are being&nbsp;decided.</p>
<h3>Allocating&nbsp;Emissions</h3>
<p>Given the political nature of emissions goals for the <span class="caps">UK</span>, it is
probably necessary for these to be set by Parliament. Obviously, there
should also be extensive national education and debate to help inform
parliament&#8217;s decision; the more grassroots involvement the better,
both in its own right and as a way to achieve buy-in for the
decarbonisation project. The point is that this decision must not be
left up to a technocratic&nbsp;body.</p>
<p>There is no purely technical fix for
global warming. We have to organise society differently to make
technical solutions possible.
However, when it comes to deciding how to achieve climate goals and
allocate the <span class="caps">UK</span>&#8217;s remaining <span class="caps">GHG</span> emissions, technical matters do come
into play. In order to ensure sufficient technical expertise is
available, I would suggest that parliament create a permanent body I
will call the National Decarbonisation Committee (<span class="caps">NDC</span>). This would
include MPs, members of devolved governments, local councillors, civil
servants, union members, scientists, engineers, everyday citizens, and
representatives of industry.<sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The goal would be to bring
together people from all of the sectors which will be most affected by
decarbonisation plans, such as electricity, gas, construction, rail,
haulage, aviation, shipping, agriculture, and heavy industry. Clearly
the <span class="caps">NDC</span> would be very large (practically a parliament in itself) and
would have to contain a number of&nbsp;subcommittees.</p>
<p>The role of the <span class="caps">NDC</span> would be to develop and implement a binding plan
for the complete decarbonisation of Britain, starting now and
stretching until whatever date Parliament has specified to achieve
that goal. This would mean taking on a number of responsibilities
currently held by the Committee on Climate Change (such as developing
carbon budgets and commissioning research papers), although the latter
body should likely continue to exist in a reduced capacity to provide
independent oversight of the <span class="caps">NDC</span>. The decarbonisation plan would set
binding <span class="caps">GHG</span> emissions for each year and for each sector. Of course,
the plan would be less detailed the further into the future it goes
and the <span class="caps">NDC</span> must be able to adapt based on changing conditions or the
development of new technology. However, the initial plan should be one
which we are confident can be achieved with minimal reliance on future&nbsp;technologies.</p>
<p>In addition to planning <span class="caps">GHG</span> emissions, the <span class="caps">NDC</span> would also need to
consider the availability of so-called
&#8220;<a href="https://nerc.ukri.org/research/partnerships/ride/lwec/ppn/ppn24/">critical metals</a>&#8220;. These
are relatively rare materials which, to date, there has not been a
great demand for. Examples include lithium, cobalt, rare earth
elements, and platinum. However, these metals are critical to the
manufacture of green technology such as batteries, generators,
photovoltaic cells, and electric motors, causing concerns that
shortages may hold up decarbonisation. The <span class="caps">NDC</span> will need to include in
its plans future extraction of critical metals and allocate investment
towards this. Furthermore, we must ensure that the rising demand for
said elements does not result in a
<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-corbyn-colonialism-climate-change-a8899876.html">new wave of imperialism</a>
with large countries racing to control reserves in Africa and turning
a blind eye to environmental and human rights abuses. This is one of
many ways in which we will need to link climate policy with foreign
policy, as will be discussed in a future&nbsp;article.</p>
<p>To develop such plans it will be useful to have some idea of what a
(net) zero carbon society will look like. For example, how much energy will
we need and how will it be produced? What sort of transportation will
people use? What materials should we be constructing buildings from?
This way, we can identify which pieces of infrastructure will prove
vital and account for their construction when budgeting for
emissions. It will also inform what sorts of research and development
will be required in coming years and prevent us building
infrastructure which might reduce emissions in the short term but not
in the long term (e.g., switching from coal powerplants to
gas). Compiling this information will require extensive consultation
both with experts (to determine what is actually possible) and the
general public (to determine what is desirable). These goals can be
achieved through planning at the local and sectoral&nbsp;level.</p>
<h3>Sectoral and Local&nbsp;Plans</h3>
<p>Once the broad outlines of carbon budgets are known for each year and
sector, it will be necessary to develop more detailed plans to meet
these objectives. This will be necessary in all sectors, but key ones
to consider will be energy, transport, agriculture, steel, and cement.
Each of these must develop their own plan for complete
decarbonisation, in line with the limits set out by the <span class="caps">NDC</span>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> 
This could be done by subcommittees of the <span class="caps">NDC</span> working with the key
companies in each&nbsp;industry.</p>
<p>At this point we begin to run into the classic problem of social
democratic economic planning: how do you make private industry
cooperate with your plans? At a minimum, clearly enforceable
regulation would be required, although this can be vulnerable to
corporate capture. In any case, how do we then ensure that companies
comply with the regulations in a socially responsible way and without
exploiting loopholes? Furthermore, industrialists are loathe to
concede any control over their enterprises to workers or the state and
may choose simply not to invest in retaliation. Under capitalism, the
state is sensitive to such actions and naturally sympathetic to the
needs of capital, as it relies on a well-functioning private economy
with which to fund itself via taxation. Thus it would be difficult for
the state to enforce such a decarbonisation program on capital unless
the latter is also under pressure from a militant working class. The
<span class="caps">NDC</span> should therefore orient itself towards empowering and educating
workers. Unions could be legally empowered to take measures up to and
including strike action to keep their employer in line. Needless to
say, we are a long way from trade unions in this country being
sufficiently mobilised or radical to do this successfully. Work must
begin to develop these capacities. In the absence of such militancy,
the <span class="caps">NDC</span> would need to rely on legal and regulatory means alone to
enforce its program as much as possible, although these are likely to
be&nbsp;insufficient.</p>
<p>I would argue that energy and transport are both of such importance to
decarbonisation that even worker militancy would not be sufficient,
however. Furthermore, both require integrated national planning which
is not possible in a fragmented and competitive market (as some
<a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/the-green-new-deal-and-the-legacy-of-public-power">relatively centrist figures have
 argued</a>
with regards to energy). As such, both will need to be taken into
public ownership in
their entirety. I will suggest a model for publicly owned energy in an
upcoming article, but suffice to say that Labour&#8217;s current policies
<a href="https://weownit.org.uk/blog/labour-beyond-national-grid-public-ownership">are not nearly ambitious enough</a>. On transport Labour is somewhat better, having
committed to nationalise rail (although we need to consider how the
<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/rail/packages/2013_en">Fourth Railway Package</a>
would effect this, depending on our future relationship with the <span class="caps">EU</span>).
Calls to regulate local busses and create new public bus companies
should go a bit further to include buying out existing bus companies
and must be extended to long-distance coach service as well. We should
also look to take as much as possible (given the balance of class
forces) of ferry services, airports, road haulage, and airlines into
national public ownership. Each of these nationalised industries would
then report to the <span class="caps">NDC</span> on their plans and progress in complying with
decarbonisation&nbsp;objectives.</p>
<p>The role of local government will also be very important. As such,
councils should develop their own decarbonisation plans. Key areas to
be addressed would likely be transport and housing. The former would
involve reducing car use in urban areas, perhaps including an outright
ban on personal vehicles in city centres (where feasible). This would
require a dramatic increase in public transit provision. Further
planning would be needed to electrify public transit, taxis, service
vehicles, and remaining cars. More details on this ambitious and
long-term project will be provided in a future article. Any socialist
government should instigate a new wave of
<a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk/a-socialist-housing-policy/">council house construction</a>,
which provides an opportunity to drastically improve energy efficiency
in homes. Furthermore, these should be multi-use developments which
are pedestrian-friendly and reduce the need for car ownership. The
<a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk/labour-and-planning-system-lessons-fracking/">planning system</a>
must begin to centre climate change in all of its decisions: no
project should be given planning permission unless it is shown to be
compatible with local and national decarbonisation goals. Finally, as
the level of government closest to individual citizens, local
authorities would be well placed to carry out education and
consultations on behalf of the <span class="caps">NDC</span>. It should be clear that these
commitments could not be carried out without reversing many of the
damaging austerity cuts to central and local&nbsp;government.</p>
<h3>Fixing our&nbsp;Technology</h3>
<p>While we should try to avoid making plans that rely on
yet-to-be-developed technology, in some cases this may be
unavoidable. Furthermore, even where current technology might, in
principle, be sufficient to allow decarbonisation we should still look
to improve upon it where possible. As previously mentioned,
decarbonisation will also greatly increase demand for certain critical
metals, which current mining technology may not be able to&nbsp;meet.</p>
<p>The rule of thumb for addressing climate change is to &#8220;electrify
everything and clean up the grid&#8221;. For example, we can address
emissions from gas boilers by switching to heat pumps powered by clean
electricity. By and large we know how to produce large amounts of
green electricity and all that is required is the political will to do
so. However, there are a few sources of emissions for which this
approach is not applicable. It could be that it is not practical to
electrify them because batteries would be too heavy and wiring can not
be made to stretch far enough (e.g., aviation and shipping). Or it
could be that something unrelated to energy consumption produces the
GHGs, such as the methane produced in the stomachs of cattle. Key areas of research would
thus&nbsp;be</p>
<ul>
<li>developing a carbon-neutral fuel for aviation, shipping, and
  long-distance road transport (e.g., hydrogen or synthetic&nbsp;hydrocarbons)</li>
<li>finding a way to smelt steel without using&nbsp;coal</li>
<li>producing cement without emitting <span class="caps">CO</span><sub>2</sub></li>
<li>capturing and storing unavoidable <span class="caps">GHG</span>&nbsp;emissions</li>
<li>improving agricultural techniques to reduce&nbsp;emissions</li>
<li>developing extraction and recycling techniques for critical&nbsp;metals</li>
</ul>
<p>If we are to see a large increase in the use of intermittent renewable
energy sources then we will also need far better energy storage
capabilities than available now. Furthermore, while
this is something it would be better to avoid, it looks increasingly
likely that some form of &#8220;negative emissions&#8221; technology will be
needed later this century to minimise warming, so research into this
should also be&nbsp;pursued.</p>
<p>In all of this we will need to harness the powers of the
entrepreneurial state. We will also need to do our utmost to integrate
research (up to and including the development of new products) with the
work of the <span class="caps">NDC</span>. Here a proposal made by Canadian socialist <a href="https://www.leftfutures.org/2017/08/a-canadian-corbyn/">Niki
Ashton</a> during
her (sadly unsuccessful) bid to lead the New Democratic
Party is instructive. <a href="https://www.leftfutures.org/2017/08/on-climate-change-the-ndps-niki-ashton-beats-corbyn/">She suggested</a> that a new state enterprise
(or &#8220;crown corporation&#8221;, to use the Canadian term) be created called
Green Canada. This&nbsp;would:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accelerate pollution-fighting technology by funding open-source
research into solutions for the climate change challenges we face
and invest in public sector clean energy innovation. Every scenario
for avoiding runaway climate change includes a technological
breakthrough we don’t have yet. The public sector has an important
role to play in fostering innovation. Green Canada will partner with
our public universities to fund and carry out basic and applied
research in renewable energy and energy efficiency at dedicated new
research institutes. The rewards of research breakthroughs will be
shared by all of us: selected successful research will be the basis
for new manufacturing projects run directly by Green Canada. In
time, this crown corporation will grow into a complex green
technology actor, reinvesting funds into research, taking on
strategic production tasks that aid in meeting climate goals and
providing the federal government with streams of revenues for other&nbsp;needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such an approach could usefully be applied in this country as well. In
addition to fostering vital research and development, by producing new
goods in-house such an enterprise would ensure that the rewards of
publicly-funded research are enjoyed by the public, rather than
privatised as often happens now. It would be able to lead the
re-purposing of polluting industries and redevelop production centres
struck by capital flight. It would also begin to cultivate
technological expertise within the state and assert the importance of
public leadership in industry, without involving the level of
confrontation with capital that would be involved in outright&nbsp;nationalisation.</p>
<h3>From the Technocratic to the&nbsp;Popular</h3>
<p>The scope of such a national decarbonisation project is almost
incomprehensible. It would require economic planning on a scale
unknown outside of a world war. However, while capital has every
reason to cooperate with the government in the context of a war, we
cannot expect it to be so enlightened in this instance. Despite
climate change posing arguably an even greater threat than the Nazis,
it is a distant one which, in any case, falls most heavily on the
poor. As such, it would be folly to expect companies to submit
themselves to a democratically decided-upon&nbsp;plan.</p>
<p>There are no easy answers to this. Subjecting capital to democratic
planning will require the workers in affected industries to be
extremely well-organised and militant to be able to scare it into
acquiescence. Unfortunately, there are no signs that this will be
available any time soon. As such, doom-mongering about the need to fix
climate change by 2030 (or whatever is the latest cutoff date) is not
useful; there is every chance that, despite our best efforts as
activists, we will not be strong enough soon enough to meet that
deadline. In this context, setting relatively short-term hard
deadlines could easily cause people to give up in despair or collapse
into&nbsp;nihilism.</p>
<p>Instead we must accept that there are no shortcuts to building a
working class movement and commit to it for the long haul. In the
short term we must take whatever inadequate climate policy is
available, while constantly arguing for much more ambitious action. By
the time we are powerful enough to carry out a full-throated program
of decarbonisation as described above it may already be too late
to limit warming to 1.5 or even 2&deg;C. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean we
shouldn&#8217;t still do it, as even then we&#8217;d still have the potential to
prevent the damage from being yet&nbsp;greater.</p>
<p>With that sombre note in mind, what can be done now to start building
the forces we need? Given the amount of democratic control over
industry which will be required, the trade unions will be key
allies. Right now they can start developing plans for
<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2019/01/gm-oshawa-democratic-planning-nafta">converting factories to green production</a>. As
this will have implications far beyond a single workplace or even a
single industry, it must be a collaborative effort between
individuals unions. The <span class="caps">TUC</span> would be well placed to take the lead on
this. More generally, all unions need to start developing proposals for
how to go about decarbonising their industries. Of course, union
representation is at fairly low levels in this country and this would
limit the portion of the economy which such an approach could
cover. As such, a strong push to organise in new workplaces will also
be very&nbsp;important.</p>
<p>However, such plans are of limited use if they are never
implemented. Unions cannot expect to make this happen simply by
asking their employers or lobbying the government. As already
mentioned, even in the context of a national push for decarbonisation,
a body like the <span class="caps">NDC</span> could easily find itself contending with
uncooperative private companies. In such circumstances one would hope
to push for worker control and self-management to break the
deadlock. In the near term, and as a step towards building the
capacities for that, unions might try to make decarbonisation part of
their bargaining demands. As an example, <span class="caps">RMT</span> could demand rail
electrification in future negotiations with Network Rail and the Train
Operating Companies. Even if this isn&#8217;t something
<a href="https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/mbzza3/how-illegal-teacher-strikes-rescued-the-american-labor-movement">over which unions can legally bargain</a>,
recent strikes by educators in the United States have shown that
unions can
<a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/12/one-two-many-chicago-teachers-strikes-2">strike over demands which are not officially up for negotiation</a>. The
same approach should be applied&nbsp;here.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Climate change is a daunting problem. Although formulating solutions
demands extensive technical knowledge, technocracy is wholly
inadequate to see these solutions implemented. The only thing which
will make capital cooperate with such plans is workers threatening to
(or actually) assert control over the workplace. Our strategy for
addressing climate change must be relentlessly focused on developing
the requisite level of knowledge and capacity to do this among
workers. This means working to educate and organise workers in
industries which will be affected by decarbonisation. The tactics
which we have seen widely used by climate activists to date have
instead focused on public spectacle (e.g., marches) or disruption
(e.g., gluing themselves to trains), which will at best temporarily
raise awareness of the issue. However, such approaches are unable to
build the capabilities of workers to oversee decarbonisation and as
such do more to make activists feel better that they are doing
something than to actually address the problem. With the limited time
and resources available to the Left, such tactics are a level of self
indulgence which we cannot&nbsp;afford.</p>

<p>It would be preferable if trade unions alone could act as
