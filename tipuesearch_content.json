{"pages":[{"text":"I am a physics student, recently having graduated with an Honours degree in Astrophysics. This fall I will begin studying for my DPhil (PhD) in Oceanic, Atmospheric, and Planetary Physics at the University of Oxford. I will be researching the interaction between the ocean and ice-shelves. Ice-shelves are edges glaciers which float on top of the ocean. The fresh water from the glacier is less dense than the salt water of the ocean, resulting in interesting fluid dynamics as the ice shelf melts. I will be investigating what instabilities can develop during the melting process which could lead to the disintegration of the ice sheets. One of my primary interests outside of physics is politics, resulting in the title of this blog. I am fiercely left-wing and consider myself a socialist. This means that I believe the economy should be collectively owned and democratically controlled. That said I'm not really a Marxist—more Marx-ish. I write various articles expressing a socialist perspective on this blog and, in particular, I try to bring to bear any politics insights arising from my perspective as a scientist. A big part of my politics is protecting the environment—hence my chosen area of study. I believe that science and technology will make it possible to live comfortably and sustainably, but that capitalism is unlikely to be able to apply those technologies in the necessary ways. My other, more mundane, major hobby is programming. I love tinkering with computers and writing software. In addition to the software which I write as part of my research, I often write programs in my spare time to fill a currently unoccupied niche.

However, as yet they do not have a practical plan for achieving this. As I have explained previously, Labour's policy proposals on green energy and climate change more generally have been disappointingly vague and limited . Unfortunately, the party has done little better when it comes to more explicitly political questions such as nationalisation . Its proposals will not amount to anything like a restoration of the post-war energy sector: only the grid is to actually be taken out of private ownership, while new local public generators and suppliers will continue to compete in the market against private ones. This fails to tackle the neoliberal electricity market which Margaret Thatcher imposed on this country, greatly limiting the public's ability to plan and exert democratic control over energy companies. Below I will attempt to outline what a more appropriate ownership structure could be for energy. The Limits of Localism Before proposing a new ownership structure for electricity, it is useful to understand how the sector is currently structured. Upon privatisation, it was split into four components: generation, transmission, distribution, and supply. Generation refers to the powerplants which produce electricity and these are owned by a wide range of companies including the Big Six, other energy multinationals, and small businesses. Transmission is owned by National Grid, plc, and consists of the high-voltage wires used to send electricity from powerplants to where it is needed across the country. National Grid also has the responsibility of \"system operator\", turning powerplants on and off (via elaborate market mechanisms) to match supply and demand. Distribution is made up of the 14 low-voltage regional grids which carry electricity from the national grid to homes and businesses. A number of companies own these, including some of the Big Six as well as multinational energy corporations. Finally, supply refers to the retailers from whom we actually purchase our energy. They buy electricity from the generators on a wholesale market through a mixture of long-term contracts and spot-trading, attempting to match the demand of their customers. The Big Six are the dominant players in the residential supply market, although a large number of private and a few local authority-owned alternatives have become available in recent years. I have written previously , about how the nature of the electrical system means that a high degree of centralisation will remain vital in this industry, even if individual power plants become more diffuse with the adoption of renewable sources. I gave numerous detailed arguments for this which there is not sufficient space to repeat here. Suffice is to say there is no avoiding the fact that a national authority will be required to plan load balancing and the correct combination of investments needed to ensure the lights stay on. The only possible alternative would be the electricity market, which for a host of reasons is unacceptable to socialists (and in any case, probably wouldn't work). Furthermore, the concentration of people in relatively dense urban centres means that there is not sufficient space for energy production to be local to them. Some have suggested that it at least does no harm to allow people to generate some of their own electricity, but even this isn't entirely true. While households owning, e.g., solar panels would reduce the amount a utility needs to spend producing electricity, the utility still needs to pay to maintain backup capacity to provides households with electricity when the sun isn't shining. One public utility in Canada claims that the revenue lost from widespread adoption of solar panels would thus be greater than the reductions in costs of operating the electrical system and that this would resulting in higher prices overall. Such a possibility is something we must be aware of when developing energy policy; what makes economic sense at the level of the individual does not necessarily lead to optimal outcomes at the national level. While it is true that centralised institutions can, at times, be alienating, that doesn't necessarily mean that decentralised ones will be more resistant to privatisation. On a recent panel discussion hosted by We Own It, Leo Murray (of 10:10 ) argued that it would be impossible to privatise the solar panels on the roof of your local primary school. Given that schools have been known to sell off their sports grounds (not to mention academisation, which is another form of privatisation despite continued receipt of state funding), I find this unconvincing. Indeed, attempts to privatise the NHS have often involved greater decentralisation and fragmentation of its management, thus breaking it into pieces of a size more digestable for the private sector. This is a common tactic in the process of privatisation, as can currently be seen with the much-vaunted SNCF in France. With all of that said, energy policy will still necessarily require local involvement. In addition to democracy and public participation being easier at this level, it can help to overcome NIMBYism and to coordinate more locally-based projects such as the upgrading of housing stock. Such arguments make the idea of a local authority-owned grids and energy suppliers attractive. While such suppliers (purchasing from a public monopoly in generation) do allow for the level of planning I have called for, they come with their own issues. First and foremost, the distribution grid is currently organised at the regional scale and it is unclear if it would be practical to break it up into locally-sized units. Secondly, if such suppliers are created with the goal of out-competing the Big Six, then this would represent a threat to (or at least disruption of) the jobs of existing employees . A Public Monopoly on Power Given the current fragmentation of the electricity structure, returning it to public ownership can not be simplified to demands such as nationalising the Big Six. Instead we must focus on the individual services and pieces of infrastructure which we wish to see under public control. Thus, the model I propose would see the creation of a nationally owned public utility made out of the national transmission grid the regional distribution grids connections to the other countries zero-carbon generators (except those small enough to receive a feed-in tariff) energy storage facilities the supply divisions of the Big Six During a transition period, the electricity market would continue to operate as before, despite most of the components being owned by the same parent company. Over this time, the divisions of the national utility would be fully merged and made to operate as a single, vertically-integrated enterprise. Contracts would be negotiated with the remaining fossil fuel power-plants to buy any additional electricity needed to meet demand from them. All new powerplants would be built in the public sector and, as fossil fuels are phased out, the public utility would come to own the vast majority of generating capacity. If desired, it could also make contracts to purchase power from locally-owned generators, although I would generally advise against this as it is likely to increase costs. The national utility would be required to develop plans stretching 20 to 30 years into the future indicating paths it can take to eliminate fossil fuels and regularly report to parliament on its progress. Gas heating will likely need to be phased out (more on this below), so it doesn't make sense to nationalise the gas infrastructure and instead we could just have the national supplier make use of the private network and producers. There is some risk that the remaining private generators and gas companies would be uncooperative faced with their imminent extinction, failing to invest adequately in maintenance. There is no simple answer to addressing this, but vigilance will be required to ensure this does not happen and, if it is found to be cheaper than bribing the private companies to cooperate, nationalisation should remain on the table. Of course, none of this provides for any localism, so I propose that each local authority would be charged with creating what I will call a Local Energy Service Company ( LESC ). The LESCs would have numerous roles and local authorities would be encouraged to experiment. However they would have two core purposes: providing an interface by which local residents could interact with the national utility and implementing energy-related projects which are inherently local in scale. Linking the National and the Local In service of the first of these goals, each LESC would be required to establish at least one storefront, preferably on the High Street. These would be similar to the storefronts which used to be operated by the old Area Electricity Boards, where people could pay their bills as well as buy electrical appliances. Both of these would also be possible at the LESC storefront. The exact relationship between the LESC and the national utility could be something like a franchise system. The national utility (or a subsidiary) would provide the stock for the store and set prices, but the LESC would handle the day-to-day management of the premises. Such public distribution would sell people high efficiency appliances at-cost. Sales could be integrated with government grants for home energy efficiency. Another possibility is leasing appliances, helping avoid the issue of high up-front cost. The national utility could try to build a supply chain of cooperatively-owned manufacturers, thus providing a mechanism for broader economic planning. However, there is an even bigger advantage to this system when it comes to the energy transition. If the electricity grid is to handle large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy sources, \"smart grid\" technology will be necessary to allow demand to adjust to meet supply. In the present system, this is often argued for in terms of consumers becoming savvier, choosing when to use electricity based on market conditions. This becomes particularly true with regards to the \"prosumer\" model, in which we all become both producers and consumers interacting on the liberalised energy market. In reality, I doubt many would actually find this prospect attractive; what people really want out of their electricity is the ability to use it without having to think too much about it. I suspect most people would rather leave such matters to the national utility which would be responsible for rationally planning the system as a whole. If the national utility begins to supply people's electrical appliances (via the LESC stores) then it becomes relatively straightforward to distribute smart appliances which can be controlled by the the grid operator. The best way to achieve this would likely be by leasing the appliances to consumers (also avoiding high up-front costs which might otherwise make them unaffordable). Customers would receive discounts on the lease depending on how aggressive the demand management is (and thus how likely it is to be noticed). Additionally, the LESC would be tasked with consulting local residents on energy plans. This could involve identifying potential sites for new generators (with the information passed on to the national utility) as well as providing feedback on national proposals. While the goal would always be to bring local communities along with decisions made by the national utility, it remains possible that NIMBYism would result in an insufficient number of locations for new power plants being identified to meet demand. Should such situations arise, it will likely be necessary for the national plan to overrule local preferences. While the Left typically takes the side of local communities against national priorities, it would be naive to ignore the fact that sometimes the national interest must take priority over local objections. Giving the Local its Due The above dealt with how the LESCs would relate to the national utility. However, there are numerous areas where they could act on their own initiative. Key to these is heating. While electricity tends to get the most attention when discussing energy, in truth it only makes up about 20% of UK energy usage . Gas (used for heat) is about 30% and petrol products (mostly used for transport) make up 50%. The latter will be left to an article in its own right. Burning gas is a source of CO ~2~, meaning we can't use it indefinitely. Biogas (produced by fermenting food waste) presents a green alternative but it won't provide enough to replace our current level of gas use. It may, however, be sufficient to power gas stoves and barbecues. Hydrogen is sometimes suggested as a replacement. However, it is often produced by removing carbon from natural gas. That carbon will have to be stored somewhere. In any case, natural gas is a limited resource. Hydrogen can also be produced cleanly from water using only electricity. Unfortunately, this wastes a fair amount of energy and other technologies, such as heat pumps, would use far less electricity to deliver the same amount of heat. These devices are very similar to air conditioners except, rather than moving heat from a relatively cool home to a warmer outdoors they move heat from a cold outdoors into a relatively warm home. Because they make use of existing heat they are far more energy efficient than conventional electric space-heaters, which must produce all of it themselves. As previously mentioned, the LESCs could supply heat pumps through their high-street retailers. However, the single most cost effective way to reduce emissions from heat is through energy efficiency. The next Labour government should immediately update the building code so that homes are built to the highest standards (i.e., PassiveHaus technology ), drastically reducing energy use. It probably won't be possible to bring most existing housing stock up to this standard, but considerable improvements can be made. This is another area in which LESCs can become involved. They could offer household efficiency assessments and work with local builders and city works departments to perform renovations. LESCs can also partner with existing grassroot initiatives along these lines, such as Carbon Co-op in Manchester , where they are present. The local company should offer to finance these renovations, although that would likely require a partnership with a larger organisation such as the national utility, public banks, or credit unions. While I have tended to dismiss local ownership of energy systems, there is a notable exception to this: district heating networks. These consist of centralised boilers for entire neighbourhoods (typically municipally or cooperatively owned), with hot water pipes carrying the heat to residents' homes. Often the heat is provided via \"co-generation\" (i.e., producing heat and electricity at the same time), although the efficiency of this is disputed . This probably will be less viable in future as gas must be phased out and the supposedly green alternative (biomass) has dubious environmental credentials at best . Waste incineration will be able to contribute, although will not be enough on its own. Some have suggested using small modular nuclear reactors (with the city council in Helsinki actively investigating this at behest of the local Greens, of all people) and this would be acceptable from a climatological perspective, although needless to say that most on the Left would not be comfortable with it. However, other sources are available to district heating networks. They can make effective use of heat which would otherwise be wasted, such as that from heavy industry, the Underground, data centres, cooling systems, large bodies of water, sewage, and heavy industry. One European study suggested that such heat sources could provide about 20% of the EU 's total heating demand by 2050. London has been developing a \"heat map\" to identify such sources and other cities should follow suit. Renewable sources such as geothermal energy and solar thermal panels can also be used, with the potential to store heat from the latter in the ground or water-filled tanks during the summer, for extraction come winter. The LESCs would be ideally placed to plan, build, own, and operate these district heating systems where heat sources are available and population density makes them viable. They would be a natural monopoly, allowing progressive tariffs to be set and/or subsidies to be given to low-income users, funded by high-income consumers. The final big user of energy is the transport sector. This is such a massive topic that it deserves an article of its own but, once again, the goals will be efficiency and electrification. Efficiency will primarily take the form of getting people out of private cars and onto public transit, bikes, or their feet. This will be a massive, multi-decade project involving the redesigning of our cities. Electrification means that the national energy utility will need to project for an increase in demand and plan its generating capacity accordingly. Meanwhile, the LESCs would be well placed to oversee the build-out of charging stations for electric vehicles. This would allow local involvement in deciding where to place them, ensuring they do not become a nuisance. Ideally, all such charging stations would be brought into local or national public ownership and payment integrated with people's monthly electricity bills. Conclusion Like all aspects of climate policy, governance of the energy grid must be able to operate on both the local and national scale. In its haste to reject \"top-down\" solutions, much of the Left in this country has lost sight of the benefits which come from being able to engage in nation-wide planning of industry. In climate policy, as in all other policy areas, we must be able to distinguish which sectors are well-suited for decentralised local control and which are not.","tags":"Energy Electricity British Politics Nationalisation","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/beyond-local-energy-delivering-public-power.html","title":"Beyond Local Energy: Delivering Public Power"},{"text":"The last few months have seen an impressive shift in public discussion on how to address climate change. Thanks in large part to newly-elected democratic socialist congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the concept of a \" Green New Deal \" has come to the fore. This marks a significant move away from previous policy proposals which have tended to rely on free market mechanisms such as carbon taxes or (worse) cap-and-trade systems to encourage a shift away from fossil fuels. Instead, Ocasio-Cortez proposes government planning and investment to achieve a rapid change in the American energy system, while providing employment for everyone willing and able to take it. As big and important a step as this is, however, we must quickly begin developing detailed proposals and demands if it is to be more than a slogan . We must start by stepping back and deciding how much future emission of greenhouse gases will be deemed acceptable. We then need to consider when and for what purposes these emissions will be produced. This will require planning at the national, local, and sectoral level. We also need to think about how mitigating climate change will shape our future R&D priorities. Finally, we must consider what strategies and tactics will be required to instigate and see through such a sweeping economic overhaul. Choosing Emissions Limits The first thing to be considered for any Green New Deal is what climate science says regarding how much more greenhouse gas ( GHG ) can be emitted. Of course, any emissions will make climate change that little bit worse, so what we really mean is what level of emissions is compatible with the amount of global warming we are willing to accept. The Paris Agreement commits us to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures, with some language about aspiring to keep warming below a 1.5°C rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) does seem to believe the latter goal is theoretically possible (although some scientists dispute this), but it would require emissions falling by about half by 2030 and reaching a net level of zero by 2050 . The emissions reductions actually pledged in the Paris Agreement, however, would only limit temperature rises to 3°C . All of this is further complicated by the fact that any statements of what reductions are needed to achieve a temperature goal are probabilistic. Because our climate models contain uncertainty, we must run a large number of subtly different simulations and analyse the range of results. Scientists will then state what will be required to have a certain probability of limiting climate change to the desired level. The upshot of this is that even if we were to cut emissions as rapidly as described above, there is still a non-negligible chance that warming would be greater than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels—perhaps considerably so. What this means is that we, as a global society, must choose the level of warming we consider to be acceptable and how confident we want to be of limiting warming to that level. At this point you might be tempted to say that there should be no further warming beyond what has already occurred and that you want to be as close to certain of that as possible. However, then we start running into a second consideration: cost. Decarbonising our society will be an expensive affair, taking up resources which could have been used for other things such as non-climate related infrastructure, increased leisure time, or international development. The faster we want to achieve it, the more expensive it will be. We thus need to consider what is the optimal trade-off between sacrifice today and climatic chaos tomorrow. This is not simply a matter of people in the Global North trying to justify inaction. Even if all GHG emissions ceased tomorrow, a certain amount of climate change is now inevitable and will require societal adaptation, particularly in the Global South. Such adaptation means building massive amounts of new infrastructure and much of this will be made from steel and concrete. Producing these materials emits CO 2 due to the chemical reactions involved. Thus, if this infrastructure is needed before these industries can be decarbonised, protecting the Global South from existing climate change may mean making climate change a little bit worse. That is not even to consider the massive amounts of non-climate infrastructure needed in developing countries, such as hospitals, decent housing, and reliable electricity. As can be seen, even the relatively simple task of deciding how much more GHG we will allow to be emitted involves very difficult and inherently political questions. The issue of which countries are allowed to produce the emissions is even more fraught. Those of us on the Left would, I hope, agree that developed countries such as the UK must take the lead in decarbonising, with much more aggressive time-tables than their developing counterparts. In the absence of a global body able to come to and enforce decisions along these lines, it will be necessary for us as socialists and internationalists to make this case domestically when emissions targets are being decided. Allocating Emissions Given the political nature of emissions goals for the UK , it is probably necessary for these to be set by Parliament. Obviously, there should also be extensive national education and debate to help inform parliament's decision; the more grassroots involvement the better, both in its own right and as a way to achieve buy-in for the decarbonisation project. The point is that this decision must not be left up to a technocratic body. There is no purely technical fix for global warming. We have to organise society differently to make technical solutions possible. However, when it comes to deciding how to achieve climate goals and allocate the UK 's remaining GHG emissions, technical matters do come into play. In order to ensure sufficient technical expertise is available, I would suggest that parliament create a permanent body I will call the National Decarbonisation Committee ( NDC ). This would include MPs, members of devolved governments, local councillors, civil servants, union members, scientists, engineers, everyday citizens, and representatives of industry. 1 The goal would be to bring together people from all of the sectors which will be most affected by decarbonisation plans, such as electricity, gas, construction, rail, haulage, aviation, shipping, agriculture, and heavy industry. Clearly the NDC would be very large (practically a parliament in itself) and would have to contain a number of sub-committees. The role of the NDC would be to develop and implement a binding plan for the complete decarbonisation of Britain, starting now and stretching until whatever date Parliament has specified to achieve that goal. This would mean taking on a number of responsibilities currently held by the Committee on Climate Change (such as developing carbon budgets and commissioning research papers), although the latter body should likely continue to exist in a reduced capacity to provide independent oversight of the NDC . The decarbonisation plan would set binding GHG emissions for each year and for each sector. Of course, the plan would be less detailed the further into the future it goes and the NDC must be able to adapt based on changing conditions or the development of new technology. However, the initial plan should be one which we are confident can be achieved with minimal reliance on future technologies. In addition to planning GHG emissions, the NDC would also need to consider the availability of so-called \" critical metals \". These are relatively rare materials which, to date, there has not been a great demand for. Examples include lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements, and platinum. However, these metals are critical to the manufacture of green technology such as batteries, generators, photovoltaic cells, and electric motors, causing concerns that shortages may hold up decarbonisation. The NDC will need to include in its plans future extraction of critical metals and allocate investment towards this. Furthermore, we must ensure that the rising demand for said elements does not result in a new wave of imperialism with large countries racing to control reserves in Africa and turning a blind eye to environmental and human rights abuses. This is one of many ways in which we will need to link climate policy with foreign policy, as will be discussed in a future article. To develop such plans it will be useful to have some idea of what a (net) zero carbon society will look like. For example, how much energy will we need and how will it be produced? What sort of transportation will people use? What materials should we be constructing buildings from? This way, we can identify which pieces of infrastructure will prove vital and account for their construction when budgeting for emissions. It will also inform what sorts of research and development will be required in coming years and prevent us building infrastructure which might reduce emissions in the short term but not in the long term (e.g., switching from coal powerplants to gas). Compiling this information will require extensive consultation both with experts (to determine what is actually possible) and the general public (to determine what is desirable). These goals can be achieved through planning at the local and sectoral level. Sectoral and Local Plans Once the broad outlines of carbon budgets are known for each year and sector, it will be necessary to develop more detailed plans to meet these objectives. This will be necessary in all sectors, but key ones to consider will be energy, transport, agriculture, steel, and cement. Each of these must develop their own plan for complete decarbonisation, in line with the limits set out by the NDC . 2 This could be done by subcommittees of the NDC working with the key companies in each industry. At this point we begin to run into the classic problem of social democratic economic planning: how do you make private industry cooperate with your plans? At a minimum, clearly enforceable regulation would be required, although this can be vulnerable to corporate capture. In any case, how do we then ensure that companies comply with the regulations in a socially responsible way and without exploiting loopholes? Furthermore, industrialists are loathe to concede any control over their enterprises to workers or the state and may choose simply not to invest in retaliation. Under capitalism, the state is sensitive to such actions and naturally sympathetic to the needs of capital, as it relies on a well-functioning private economy with which to fund itself via taxation. Thus it would be difficult for the state to enforce such a decarbonisation program on capital unless the latter is also under pressure from a militant working class. The NDC should therefore orient itself towards empowering and educating workers. Unions could be legally empowered to take measures up to and including strike action to keep their employer in line. Needless to say, we are a long way from trade unions in this country being sufficiently mobilised or radical to do this successfully. Work must begin to develop these capacities. In the absence of such militancy, the NDC would need to rely on legal and regulatory means alone to enforce its program as much as possible, although these are likely to be insufficient. I would argue that energy and transport are both of such importance to decarbonisation that even worker militancy would not be sufficient, however. Furthermore, both require integrated national planning which is not possible in a fragmented and competitive market (as some relatively centrist figures have argued with regards to energy). As such, both will need to be taken into public ownership in their entirety. I will suggest a model for publicly owned energy in an upcoming article, but suffice to say that Labour's current policies are not nearly ambitious enough . On transport Labour is somewhat better, having committed to nationalise rail (although we need to consider how the Fourth Railway Package would effect this, depending on our future relationship with the EU ). Calls to regulate local busses and create new public bus companies should go a bit further to include buying out existing bus companies and must be extended to long-distance coach service as well. We should also look to take as much as possible (given the balance of class forces) of ferry services, airports, road haulage, and airlines into national public ownership. Each of these nationalised industries would then report to the NDC on their plans and progress in complying with decarbonisation objectives. The role of local government will also be very important. As such, councils should develop their own decarbonisation plans. Key areas to be addressed would likely be transport and housing. The former would involve reducing car use in urban areas, perhaps including an outright ban on personal vehicles in city centres (where feasible). This would require a dramatic increase in public transit provision. Further planning would be needed to electrify public transit, taxis, service vehicles, and remaining cars. More details on this ambitious and long-term project will be provided in a future article. Any socialist government should instigate a new wave of council house construction , which provides an opportunity to drastically improve energy efficiency in homes. Furthermore, these should be multi-use developments which are pedestrian-friendly and reduce the need for car ownership. The planning system must begin to centre climate change in all of its decisions: no project should be given planning permission unless it is shown to be compatible with local and national decarbonisation goals. Finally, as the level of government closest to individual citizens, local authorities would be well placed to carry out education and consultations on behalf of the NDC . It should be clear that these commitments could not be carried out without reversing many of the damaging austerity cuts to central and local government. Fixing our Technology While we should try to avoid making plans that rely on yet-to-be-developed technology, in some cases this may be unavoidable. Furthermore, even where current technology might, in principle, be sufficient to allow decarbonisation we should still look to improve upon it where possible. As previously mentioned, decarbonisation will also greatly increase demand for certain critical metals, which current mining technology may not be able to meet. The rule of thumb for addressing climate change is to \"electrify everything and clean up the grid\". For example, we can address emissions from gas boilers by switching to heat pumps powered by clean electricity. By and large we know how to produce large amounts of green electricity and all that is required is the political will to do so. However, there are a few sources of emissions for which this approach is not applicable. It could be that it is not practical to electrify them because batteries would be too heavy and wiring can not be made to stretch far enough (e.g., aviation and shipping). Or it could be that something unrelated to energy consumption produces the GHGs, such as the methane produced in the stomachs of cattle. Key areas of research would thus be developing a carbon-neutral fuel for aviation, shipping, and long-distance road transport (e.g., hydrogen or synthetic hydrocarbons) finding a way to smelt steel without using coal producing cement without emitting CO 2 capturing and storing unavoidable GHG emissions improving agricultural techniques to reduce emissions developing extraction and recycling techniques for critical metals If we are to see a large increase in the use of intermittent renewable energy sources then we will also need far better energy storage capabilities than available now. Furthermore, while this is something it would be better to avoid, it looks increasingly likely that some form of \"negative emissions\" technology will be needed later this century to minimise warming, so research into this should also be pursued. In all of this we will need to harness the powers of the entrepreneurial state. We will also need to do our utmost to integrate research (up to and including the development of new products) with the work of the NDC . Here a proposal made by Canadian socialist Niki Ashton during her (sadly unsuccessful) bid to lead the New Democratic Party is instructive. She suggested that a new state enterprise (or \"crown corporation\", to use the Canadian term) be created called Green Canada. This would: Accelerate pollution-fighting technology by funding open-source research into solutions for the climate change challenges we face and invest in public sector clean energy innovation. Every scenario for avoiding runaway climate change includes a technological breakthrough we don't have yet. The public sector has an important role to play in fostering innovation. Green Canada will partner with our public universities to fund and carry out basic and applied research in renewable energy and energy efficiency at dedicated new research institutes. The rewards of research breakthroughs will be shared by all of us: selected successful research will be the basis for new manufacturing projects run directly by Green Canada. In time, this crown corporation will grow into a complex green technology actor, reinvesting funds into research, taking on strategic production tasks that aid in meeting climate goals and providing the federal government with streams of revenues for other needs. Such an approach could usefully be applied in this country as well. In addition to fostering vital research and development, by producing new goods in-house such an enterprise would ensure that the rewards of publicly-funded research are enjoyed by the public, rather than privatised as often happens now. It would be able to lead the re-purposing of polluting industries and redevelop production centres struck by capital flight. It would also begin to cultivate technological expertise within the state and assert the importance of public leadership in industry, without involving the level of confrontation with capital that would be involved in outright nationalisation. From the Technocratic to the Popular The scope of such a national decarbonisation project is almost incomprehensible. It would require economic planning on a scale unknown outside of a world war. However, while capital has every reason to cooperate with the government in the context of a war, we cannot expect it to be so enlightened in this instance. Despite climate change posing arguably an even greater threat than the Nazis, it is a distant one which, in any case, falls most heavily on the poor. As such, it would be folly to expect companies to submit themselves to a democratically decided-upon plan. There are no easy answers to this. Subjecting capital to democratic planning will require the workers in affected industries to be extremely well-organised and militant to be able to scare it into acquiescence. Unfortunately, there are no signs that this will be available any time soon. As such, doom-mongering about the need to fix climate change by 2030 (or whatever is the latest cutoff date) is not useful; there is every chance that, despite our best efforts as activists, we will not be strong enough soon enough to meet that deadline. In this context, setting relatively short-term hard deadlines could easily cause people to give up in despair or collapse into nihilism. Instead we must accept that there are no shortcuts to building a working class movement and commit to it for the long haul. In the short term we must take whatever inadequate climate policy is available, while constantly arguing for much more ambitious action. By the time we are powerful enough to carry out a full-throated program of decarbonisation as described above it may already be too late to limit warming to 1.5 or even 2°C. However, that doesn't mean we shouldn't still do it, as even then we'd still have the potential to prevent the damage from being yet greater. With that sombre note in mind, what can be done now to start building the forces we need? Given the amount of democratic control over industry which will be required, the trade unions will be key allies. Right now they can start developing plans for converting factories to green production . As this will have implications far beyond a single workplace or even a single industry, it must be a collaborative effort between individuals unions. The TUC would be well placed to take the lead on this. More generally, all unions need to start developing proposals for how to go about decarbonising their industries. Of course, union representation is at fairly low levels in this country and this would limit the portion of the economy which such an approach could cover. As such, a strong push to organise in new workplaces will also be very important. However, such plans are of limited use if they are never implemented. Unions cannot expect to make this happen simply by asking their employers or lobbying the government. As already mentioned, even in the context of a national push for decarbonisation, a body like the NDC could easily find itself contending with uncooperative private companies. In such circumstances one would hope to push for worker control and self-management to break the deadlock. In the near term, and as a step towards building the capacities for that, unions might try to make decarbonisation part of their bargaining demands. As an example, RMT could demand rail electrification in future negotiations with Network Rail and the Train Operating Companies. Even if this isn't something over which unions can legally bargain , recent strikes by educators in the United States have shown that unions can strike over demands which are not officially up for negotiation . The same approach should be applied here. Conclusion Climate change is a daunting problem. Although formulating solutions demands extensive technical knowledge, technocracy is wholly inadequate to see these solutions implemented. The only thing which will make capital cooperate with such plans is workers threatening to (or actually) assert control over the workplace. Our strategy for addressing climate change must be relentlessly focused on developing the requisite level of knowledge and capacity to do this among workers. This means working to educate and organise workers in industries which will be affected by decarbonisation. The tactics which we have seen widely used by climate activists to date have instead focused on public spectacle (e.g., marches) or disruption (e.g., gluing themselves to trains), which will at best temporarily raise awareness of the issue. However, such approaches are unable to build the capabilities of workers to oversee decarbonisation and as such do more to make activists feel better that they are doing something than to actually address the problem. With the limited time and resources available to the Left, such tactics are a level of self indulgence which we cannot afford. It would be preferable if trade unions alone could act as industrial representatives, but given that we live under capitalism for the moment it seems inevitable we will at least need to hear the opinion of management. ↩ In reality, there may be a certain amount of back and forth here as different industries provide information on what resources they will need to stay within their carbon budget. ↩","tags":"Energy Climate Change British Politics Planning","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/beyond-slogans-sketching-a-green-new-deal.html","title":"Beyond Slogans: Sketching a Green New Deal"},{"text":"During last year's conference, the Labour Party made headlines with its seemingly bold promises on energy and climate change. These included a massive build-out of wind turbines, solar panels, and a housing retrofit programme. We were promised that these pledges would be elaborated on in a report to be released that weekend. However, said report proved to be woefully inadequate in terms of what we need to tackle climate change, as will be revealed in the summary and discussion below. Despite the apparent magnitude of its programme, Labour still has not truly grasped the scale of the task of confronting climate change. What's in the Report The report opens with a one-page overview explaining that it sets out key findings of research into how to achieve Labour's 2017 commitment to get 60% of the UK 's electricity and heat from renewable and low-carbon sources. (Note that the exact relationship between these two types of energy is not made clear in this paper; much heating is powered by electricity.) This research focuses on \"the scale and scope of technologies required for Labour to meet the 60% target\". Future work will consider the concrete actions needed to achieve it. It states that this work is merely to provide information and \"does not represent Labour Party policy\". A number of \"industry professionals and experts … from right across the energy sector\" who contributed to the document are listed. Rebecca Long-Bailey (Shadow Secretary for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy) provides a foreword. This does not go beyond indicating that Labour is determined to address climate change in an equitable manner. She reaffirms Labour's policy of net zero emissions by 2050 and pledges Labour will ensure \"60 per cent of the UK 's energy comes from renewable and low carbon sources within twelve years of coming to power.\" This contradicts statements made elsewhere in the document which said the 60% target applied only to electricity and heat. The single longest portion of the report is the introduction, which makes it clear that this document is only a \"briefing note\". A \"full report, to be published later in the year … will set out our intended pathways for upgrading the whole energy system, including other electricity generation technologies, UK heating and our approach for non-domestic buildings\". To date the full paper still does not appear to have been published, but given Labour's haphazard way of publishing and publicising its own policy documents it is difficult to know for certain. The introduction goes on to claim that \"Britain has the best opportunities for renewable energy of almost any country in the world\" and explains that the current paper will look at \"four key elements\" of Labour's plans: energy efficiency, offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar power. Many short-term benefits of such a policy are described: eliminating fuel poverty (and improved well-being that results), cleaner air, eliminating \"the obscene wastefulness of our current, high-polluting energy system\", and energy security for \"decades to come\" with protection from fluctuations in fuel prices. This will be achieved by reducing heating demand by 23% and producing 85% of electricity and 44% of heat from renewable sources. Such actions are estimated to create 410,000 jobs, will require massive infrastructure renewal, and will affect \"almost all [non-energy] sectors\". These steps will allow the UK to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement. We are reassured that, despite the intermittency of wind and solar power, \"the lights will stay on\" and that \"this paper shows that even a limited selection of the cost-effective technical solutions available today would be more than sufficient\" to do this. The report proposes installing 4GW of new offshore wind capacity every year through the 2020s, bringing the UK 's total up to 52GW . This will allow the UK to harness \"the largest wind resource in Europe\", taking advantage of falling costs and new technologies. It is mentioned that offshore wind works well to offset lower solar power production in winter. It is estimated that, by sourcing components from domestic suppliers, this policy would result in the creation of 120,000 jobs. There is a further proposal to bring installed onshore wind capacity to 30GW by 2030, taking advantage of cheaper building costs than offshore wind and a \"low footprint\". This is expected to create an additional 60,000 jobs. On solar power, the report suggests increasing installed capacity to 35GW by 2030, installing 2. 2GW per year and creating 70,000 jobs. It is noted that capacity has grown massively since 2010, despite a slowdown due to \"actions of the Tory government\". While installations were initially small scale, it is noted that larger installations now dominate. Finally, it is proposed to cut domestic heat demand by about one quarter by 2030 by upgrading buildings to the highest standards of efficiency (as well as making non-energy related improvements), with 24 million homes upgraded by 2030. Higher energy standards will be enforced for all new homes. In addition to addressing climate change, this policy will improve energy poverty and quality of life. Efficiency is noted as being vital to meet the 60% target, given the large amount of heating currently used and difficulty in shifting to renewable heat. This project will \"require a scale of investment, supply chain capacity building and innovation as yet unseen in post-war Britain \" (emphasis added) and would create 160,000 jobs. Problems Though described as a summary, the above is a fairly complete reproduction of the actual content present in this 14 page report. No citations or arguments were given for any of the claims made. Given how little information the document contained, it is unclear what it was intended to achieve. It is essential that we are told what sectors the 60% clean energy target applies to. The manifesto simply pledged to \"ensure that 60 per cent of the UK 's energy comes from zero-carbon or renewable sources by 2030\", but this document (except the comments made by Rebecca Long-Bailey) claims this referred only to electricity and heating. However, together these make up less than half of current UK energy consumption. If this is current policy then it represents a massive retreat by Labour. The relationship between \"zero carbon\" and \"renewable\" sources is also unclear. The plans presented in this document are for 60% renewable (electric and heating) energy by 2030. Is it intended that we should take \"zero carbon\" to just be a synonym for \"renewable\"? If so, what do we make of biomass which, while renewable, even the most generous estimates show emitting some greenhouse gases. ( The IPPC estimates 230gCO 2 /kWh, about 1/3 those from gas, but under certain circumstances it may be even worse than fossil fuels.) Jeremy Corbyn has indicated that nuclear will also make up part of the zero-carbon energy mix. Even existing reactors are not shown in this paper's plans for 2030 (let alone the new ones Labour supposedly supports). Do the authors not think we need them? Whatever one's stance on nuclear energy, Labour members deserve to know how it fits into climate change plans. If existing hydro and biomass capacity is included, then the proposed new wind and solar installations would produce the promised amount of renewable electricity. However, that's only a small part of the battle. The real challenge will be to achieve \"system integration\", allowing the lights to remain on when the wind isn't blowing. These problems are dismissed as easily solved, with no explanation of how it would be done. It would probably be possible to do this for 60% renewable electricity, but gas plants would be needed for backup. Rather than just looking at the requirements for 60% renewable energy, as this paper claims to do, we need to think about how we'll actually achieve 100% clean energy. Otherwise we could lock ourselves into dependence on fossil fuels in the medium term. No explanation is given of what will provide the 44% renewable heat. Indeed, the term itself is not clear and is never defined. Electricity and hydrogen are mentioned. However, all existing and proposed renewable installations will be needed to meet targets for existing electricity demand. Hydrogen takes energy to produce and this is not budgeted for either. There are a number of other issues I could also challenge this paper on, but I will end here for reasons of space. As the authors say, we urgently need a plan to address climate change. It is a shame, therefore, that they have not provided us with one. Hopefully they will do so in the full report (if it is ever published) but, if so, I don't see why this lightweight document was released. Finally, we need to consider the way in which this report was written. Of the 10 authors, Internet searching revealed details on 8 of them. One of these is an academic researcher, another is a policy analyst at Ofgem, and the rest are energy or climate change consultants. All of the consultants work for the same company (Arup). One of the remaining two may run a business installing solar panels, but I'm not sure. All things considered, this seems like a less-than-diverse pool of expertise. Why weren't the unions involved? What about people who work at power plants, build wind farms, or do load balancing for National Grid? Even beyond exactly who was chosen to write this report, given the weakness of its arguments and how little effort was made to distribute it to members, it feels like policy is being formed by small groups of leadership-appointed experts. This is a far cry from the membership-led policy formation which Jeremy Corbyn promised when he was elected leader. The Missing Ingredient: Politics This report and, it seems, the full version of it which is to come, deals with technical, rather than political questions. In and of itself, this is fine; Labour needs to ensure its policies are grounded in what is technologically feasible. However, we mustn't lose sight of the political aspects of these issues, either. Political assumptions inform the context in which technical discussions take place. For example, anti-nuclear activists often argue that this technology only receives consideration due to its compatibility with centralised government and big business (not to mention its military applications). Conversely, its few left wing supporters suggest that nuclear power appears artificially expensive due to the high cost and short-term thinking of private finance and can be built much more cheaply in the public sector. The technical and political are linked, forming a dialectic which we must navigate. The most obvious case of missing politics is the paper's support for rooftop solar panels. Their installation in uncritically treated as a good thing, without any consideration of who benefits. To date this has largely been well-off property owners, who've received a subsidy paid for by other electricity consumers. Labour seems to want solar panels to also be placed on rental property, which begs the question of who will own them. It's hard to imagine how the tenant could be the one to finance the panels, but if it's the landlord who's paying for them then presumably it would also be the landlord receiving the government subsidy (either directly or through increased rent). We thus see how politics can very quickly infringe upon technical plans. Rather than examine these issues, the paper ignores them. As Labour continues its work on energy policy, it is vital that it considers exactly how it wishes to organise ownership of the sector. To date it seems to have endorsed a plurality of structures, consisting of regional, local, personal, and cooperative ownership. I have, in the past, criticised this approach as incapable of delivering the national-level planning that will be necessary to build a low-carbon grid and will not repeat myself here. However, even many proponents of such a system often acknowledge the need to abolish the energy market and provide some sort of national guidance. Yet we have been given no indication of what form this might take, by Labour or anyone else. Probably the closest this Labour document comes to truly considering the political implications of its proposals is when it says about its energy efficiency measures that \"This level of ambition represents an unprecedented transformation of the UK 's housing stock and will require a scale of investment, supply chain capacity building and innovation as yet unseen in post-war Britain\". This is a fair assessment, with the task becoming all the more massive when considering the myriad other policies needed to address climate change. In short, it would require something on the scale of war-time economic planning. The problem is that, during the World Wars, the government could rely on an alliance with business. While capital might not have liked submitting to government control, it acknowledged that this was necessary in order to win the war. As national capital would not have fared well had Britain been on the losing side, they had a fairly immediate interest in cooperating. Unfortunately, the effects of climate change are sufficiently distant and diffuse (not to mention, concentrated in the Global South) that business is unlikely to see the need for such cooperation with public planners today. This represents a formidable obstacle which, as far as I'm aware, no one has really considered. I can not confidently propose a solution to this, other than to say that clearly a powerful working class movement, dedicated to an environmental transition in the economy, will be necessary. Only such a popular force can scare capital into acquiescence or (as I think will likely prove necessary) actually begin to take democratic control of key economic sectors. Over the following series of articles, I will outline some of the necessary technical elements of a strategy to address climate change and suggest policies which a socialist government could use to achieve these. By and large this will be focusing on what policies Labour government can adopt at the national and (to a lesser extent) local level, rather than the equally important grassroots mobilisation and capacity building which must also occur. Where possible, I will indicate where government policy could link up with grassroots efforts. My first article in the series will focus on the concept of a \"Green New Deal\", providing an overall strategy for decarbonisation and examining how this requires cooperation across a wide range of both sectors and scales. I will then focus on some key individual sectors, including energy, transport, housing, and food/agriculture. Finally (and perhaps most importantly), the international dimensions of climate change will be considered.","tags":"Energy Electricity British Politics Labour Party","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/labours-energy-plans-technically-questionable-politically-vacuous.html","title":"Labour's Energy Plans: Technically Questionable, Politically Vacuous"},{"text":"Well, we finally have a proposed agreement by which the UK could withdraw from the EU . It's just a pity that no one actually agrees with it. In fact, disagreeing with it is about the only thing the House of Commons can agree on. The Situation as it Stands OK , smart-assed comments aside, the Brexit process is in dire straights. With barely more than 100 days until Brexit, Theresa May has secured a deal which the EU insists is not up for any renegotiation. However, her MPs (and the Democratic Unionists, on whose votes she relies) won't pass it because of the controversial \"backstop\" measure. Should the UK and EU fail to negotiate a post-Brexit agreement which would prevent the re-assertion of a \"hard border\" in Northern Ireland, the backstop will automatically enter into effect at the end of Britain's two year \"transition period\". It provides something similar to single-market membership (although with some important differences). 1 Terminating the backstop will require mutual consent of both the UK and EU , causing some to fear that the EU will trap Britain in a perpetual \"Brexit in name only\". I understand why the EU wants this. They need a guarantee the Northern Irish border will remain open. The backstop wouldn't be able to offer that if the UK could unilaterally renege. That said, I also completely understand why MPs are uncomfortable with this; signing an agreement which you can not get out of is a risk. For its part, the Labour Party was never going to accept any deal which the Tories brought to parliament. Their six tests were designed to be impossible to achieve from the start. 2 Rather than put any serious work into fleshing out what they'd like Brexit to look like, alongside various alternatives should the EU prove unforthcoming in negotiations, they've taken an obstructionist stance. I suspect this is in an attempt to manage the internal contradictions within the party. Its members are majority pro- EU , but a majority of its constituencies voted to leave. To get elected requires the votes of both Remainers and Leavers. The party's current stance has proven sufficiently ambiguous that it hasn't alienated either of these groups, but a serious discussion of how to go about Brexit would likely do just that. So there is no way the deal is getting through parliament. However, without a deal, the UK will automatically exit the EU on 29 March. It would revert to WTO rules for trade with the EU , while Europeans living in Britain would be left in a legal limbo of being neither legal nor illegal. None of the bilateral treaties which normally facilitate commerce, trade, and travel between countries would exist and nor would the infrastructure needed to process trade without such benefits. This would likely cause massive backlogs at ports of entry which are predicted to lead to shortages of food and medicines, as well as halt any manufacturing which depends on European supply chains. The Irish Question The real root of the problem is Northern Ireland. Key to the Good Friday Agreement was keeping a soft border between Ireland and Ulster. However, so the logic goes, a soft border is only possible with a high degree of regulatory harmonisation and free movement of goods, people, and services, i.e. membership of the Single Market. Thus, any attempt to take the UK out of the Single Market was always going to cause problems. In many regards this is the tail wagging the dog. A tiny region with less than 2 million people, disconnected from the country at large, is preventing the results of a referendum in which 33 million people voted from being implemented. What's more, it's a region which is only part of the UK due to past imperialism. In many ways, the tidiest solution would be a united Ireland (which may actually happen, depending on how Brexit proceeds, although not in time to make negotiations any more straightforward). Anyway, barring that, there are limited options. One is to give Northern Ireland special status within the UK , so that it remains within the Single Market while Great Britain leaves. There would thus need to be customs on goods moving between the two; i.e., the hard border would lie in the Irish Sea. That is certainly much more practical to implement than a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and it is sort of the inverse of the current situation with overseas territories of EU member states (e.g., islands in the Caribbean). The EU appears to be open to this option, but it is unpopular with Unionists and has been completely ruled out by the Democratic Unionist Party supporting Theresa May in parliament. Another option would be to accept that the border won't be quite as soft as it has been in the past, but pursue every possible means to minimise it. This has been achieved to some degree at the Swiss border using digital systems to process customs in advance and avoid the use of checkpoints. If coupled with limited checks between Northern Ireland and Britain (e.g., for transport of animals) then this might be technically achievable. However, it doesn't look like Ireland or the EU would consider it sufficient to meet their requirements. It's also not clear that the Northern Irish themselves would accept it. However, if such a system could be implemented then it might conceivably represent a means to get out of the backstop. What Should We Want? So far I've been discussing this purely in terms of what can get through parliament as it stands now. However, there is also the question of what the Left would like as an outcome. Most supported Remain and would thus prefer to simply revoke Brexit and stay in the EU . As such, there has been a lot of demand for a second referendum on the final terms of the deal. However, many other Remainers are worried about that, feeling that we need to respect the democratic decision of the original referendum and fearing not doing so could massively embolden the reactionary Right. And then there are those, such as myself, who think that pursuing socialism will be impossible within the EU and would thus like a Brexit which gets the UK out of Single Market rules which inhibit state aid, enforce open competition, and forbid capital controls. This entails a relatively hard Brexit. While I don't object in principle to Labour's desire for a customs union with the EU which nonetheless would not bind the UK to neoliberal EU policy, I don't think such a deal is likely to be forthcoming. Given that, the UK should have told Northern Ireland that one way or another Britain will be leaving the Single Market and the customs union. It would then have been up to them whether this would mean a united Ireland, special status for Northern Ireland within the UK , or some hardening of the Northern Irish border. Of course, it would be necessary to evaluate whether any or all of these outcomes would be likely to restart the Troubles (although I'm inclined to doubt they would). Assuming they wouldn't, these choices could be put to the Northern Irish people in a ranked-choice referendum. The UK would then get to work establishing a framework to leave the Single Market. This wouldn't happen immediately and would require at least a couple years of transition period, during which the UK is outside of the EU but inside the Single Market. This would provide time to negotiate the agreements necessary for a hard Brexit to work. These would not necessarily be free trade agreements in the sense of eliminating tariffs; with the exception of a few sectors, tariffs would probably be low enough to be manageable. The real issue is all the other barriers to trade such as regulatory inspections, paperwork around customs, sanitary provisions for the export of live animals, etc. 3 Agreements exist with other countries which would harmonise and expedite all of this sufficiently to allow relatively smooth trade. However, it would take time to negotiate and implement these for the UK , hence the need of a transitional period within the Single Market. This could potentially take the form of a phased withdrawal, with different aspects of Single Market membership being dropped over time (assuming the EU would agree, of course). For example, liberalisation directives for railways might be dropped immediately, on the condition that UK rail companies would no longer be eligible to bid for EU operating contracts. This would allow Labour to immediately begin the process of taking the railways back into public ownership. There's not guarantee that these negotiations would be easy and at least some aspects of them would probably drag on for many years. However, it at the very least seems like a more reality-based plan than what the Labour Party is currently calling for. However, now we are at a point where there is no time to negotiate such an agreement. The Options Before Us At this point, there are really only three plausible options: The deal which the EU has offered (or something very similar). No deal. Remaining. Labour continues to call for a general election to resolve the parliamentary deadlock and while I would be pleased with anything which would get the Tories out of government, whoever succeeds them will face the same set of choices as we do now. Unfortunately, publicly at least, Labour has not realised that. At a recent Constituency Labour Party meeting I asked the local MP (who is in the Shadow Treasury Team) what Labour would like to change about the existing deal and it basically came down wanting a commitment a permanent customs union. I'm given to understand that the EU is not willing to negotiate such agreements at this point, 4 but even if that's not the case there is simply no time to negotiate a customs union before Brexit day. Perhaps the EU could be convinced to extend the negotiation period, but it would require all 27 other member states to agree and this is by no means guaranteed. This Deal No one on the Left likes the current deal. It would lock the UK into Single Market rules (including all of the neoliberal ones) without having any say over them, at least until the backstop is over. The attached (non-binding) political declaration indicates a desire for any future agreement negotiated by the Tories to do much the same around issues of state aid and competition. As such, not only Remainers object to the current settlement, but most left-Leavers too. However, Chris Bickerton (a left-Leaver and European scholar who wrote The European Union: A Citizen's Guide ) has argued that at this point it is the best we are going to get, that the EU has ample incentive not to keep the UK trapped in the backstop, and that it represents something from which we can negotiate improvements. 5 No Deal For the most part, only the Right has flirted with the prospect of No Deal, believing it would give them carte blanche to turn the UK into a libertarian free-trade hellhole. Most people reject it out of hand, given the projection of shortages, planes being grounded, and Kent being turned into a car-park for lorries that aren't being allowed into Calais. Nonetheless, at least one left-Leaver has suggested that we should take this option, viewing it as the option least likely to constrain a future socialist government. 6 A number of pro-Brexit sources have sought to downplay fears around No Deal, although many of them are based on arguments of how other countries trade with the EU while ignoring the numerous treaties which they have negotiated to make this possible. 7 While some contingency plans have been agreed between the UK and EU in case of a No Deal outcome and both parties have made some unilateral preparations, these hardly appear sufficient to avoid at least some disruption. As far as I can tell, what would be likely to occur in the event of No Deal would be a failure to enforce the usual rules of international trade. Britain would likely continue to treat trade entering the country the same was as the day before, despite the fact this would technically violate WTO rules (as they would be favouring some nations over others, without having free trade agreements). It's harder to predict the actions of the EU , as they'd be less affected by the cessation of trade and would thus have less incentive to bend rules. It appears only minimal air service would be permitted. It seems clear that neither the UK nor Ireland have any plan of enforcing the Northern Irish border in the event of No Deal, so who knows what the legal status of trade would be there. The best that could be hoped for in this outcome is that basic trade would be allowed to prevent the UK from collapsing and that the chaos would force the EU and UK to rush through the agreements necessary to make trade possible. All things considered, to me this does not sound like an outcome the Left should permit. Remain The Labour Party is divided on the prospect of a second referendum (in Oxford, a motion calling on the leadership to call for one and campaign for remain passed by only a few votes). As a solution, it comes with an awful lot of practical problems of its own. There is the issue of what exactly the question would be and what options would be available. May's deal and no deal? May's deal and remain? All three? It would also almost certainly be impossible to pass the requisite legislation and hold the legally-required campaign prior to Brexit Day and very difficult to do so before the coming spring's EU elections (by which time the EU wants the UK to have left). But, without another referendum, Remaining could massively undermine the legitimacy of the UK 's democratic institutions (and they aren't in great shape already). I suppose the UK could withdraw its invocation of Article 50, thus cancelling Brexit, and then reactivate it should Leave win the referendum, but I'd imagine this would be a tough sell. There is also the question of whether Labour could implement its policies within the EU . Lots of people claim it can, but they don't seem to know about the 4th Railway Package which insists that in future all routes either be put out to tender or be open to competition from other operators. This would seem to limit Labour's pledge to renationalise the railways to having a public operator compete for franchises, as was party policy under Ed Miliband. At the time this was seen by the Left as a half measure meant to avoid talk of nationalisation. The other major issue is capital controls. While Labour hasn't really talked about these, historically the Post-War Consensus relied on such controls and capital flight has often been able to undermine radical Left governments. The real issue, though, is that even if Labour's last manifesto may have been permitted under EU law, more radical policy (which we should be pushing towards) would not. 8 Some suggest, with varying degrees of reluctance or excitement, a \"Remain and Reform\" position. 9 I think this is naive about prospects for reform. Despite the rhetoric you sometimes hear about uniting with other socialists within Europe, this usually means social democrats that I do not believe will work for the policies required. I've yet to see a serious strategy for how to go about achieving reforms, given the massive democratic deficit inherent in EU bodies and the lack of any European demos. 10 If we are to pursue this approach then it seems to me that the only practical policy is \"Remain and Rebel \", knowingly and wilfully violating neoliberal EU directives and refusing to obey ECJ rulings against the UK . We'd have to hope this would expose the EU for the neoliberal machine it is and create a movement for reform, before any retaliatory sanctions become too unbearable. Unfortunately, hardly anyone in Labour conceives of Remain this way and I have serious doubts that it could work. As circumstances change, that may yet become the best strategy, but I don't think we're there yet. One final note on this. The EU has a history of repeating, or outright ignoring, referenda which went against further integration. I admit that part of my resistance to another referendum is the feeling that it continues this dangerous and undemocratic history. This despite the fact that the arguments for a second referendum in this case are far better than those in previous ones. I'm not saying this is a strong argument on my part, but it is there in the back of my mind nonetheless. More important is that this would perpetuate the whole narrative that There Is No Alternative to the EU . I'm deeply uncomfortable with creating a precedent which suggests leaving the EU is impossible. So, What's the Best Choice? No, I'm not going to borrow that old cliche from Lenin… Nonetheless, clearly the Left needs some sort of strategy going forward. For what it's worth, I think that the best choice is accepting something like the current deal. It's not a good deal, but I found Bickerton's arguments for it far more convincing than arguments for No Deal and I'm not at the point yet where I think we should go for Remain. Were I leading the Parliamentary Labour Party, I would go through the agreement with a fine-toothed comb and find exactly what the most problematic aspects of it are. I would then write up a series of amendments I would like to see. At present I can think of a few: Make the backstop only apply to Northern Ireland, which the EU was open to in the past If that proves possible, add a referendum in Northern Ireland as a way of ending the backstop Removal of commitments in the political declaration (which details plans for negotiation future agreements) dealing with maintaining EU rules on state aid, competition, etc. If the Tories won't agree to that, then ask them to leave these in as only a possible path. Clarification that, should there be a change of government prior to finalising the post-Brexit agreements, the new administration can change its negotiating priorities A commitment that all future agreements can be will be open to renegotiation and will not lock in either party in perpetuity Labour would then offer to help Theresa May pass her Brexit agreement if she can get these amendments and commits to triggering a general election immediately afterwords . The first of these would, of course, alienate the Democratic Unionists and a good number of Tories, but hopefully Labour would be able to marshal sufficient numbers in parliament that this would not be a problem. Should May then try to renege on holding a general election, the Unionists could almost certainly be relied upon to give a vote of no confidence against her, bringing the government down anyway. Of course, the EU probably won't agree to all demands. They're insisting that the deal is now closed. The first demand is something they've proposed in the past themselves, though, so if changes can be made it would be that one. The penultimate point wouldn't require reopening the withdrawal agreement and would likely just be an annex to the political declaration (which is itself non-binding), so it should be achievable. This is the commitment which I think should be an absolute red line. If Labour can't get that out of either the Tories or the EU then it is time to start thinking about Remain as an option. There are, of course, risks to this approach. If Theresa May or the EU won't apply the backstop only to Northern Ireland then there is nothing to ensure she'll stick to her promise to hold new elections. Or, Labour might lose those elections. This, of course, is the risk of democracy: sometimes people disagree with you. Elections could also yield a similarly unworkable parliament. However, in that case the backstop would kick in, so there wouldn't be an immediate threat to the economy like now. It would essentially stabilise us on the status quo. Labour's capacity to fight to change the EU rules would be little changed from what it is now (i.e., extremely limited) and rebelling would be about equally effective. If that really is the best we can achieve then we could consider trying to transfer to EFTA / EEA membership, which would likely have some minor advantages over the backstop. 11 The final question is whether this would be seen as Labour conspiring with the Tories, causing a wave of anti-establishment disgust with the party. I hope that demanding amendments to the agreement would help to mitigate this. Even without those amendments, however, I don't see the risks as being any worse than those of backing another referendum to Remain. Final Thoughts Brexit looks set to be the defining issue in UK politics for the foreseeable future. As an issue it is uniquely polarising and one about which few have shown any ability to hold informed discussion. Both of the major parties are deeply divided on the issue and it will be incredibly difficult for either of them to pursue a coherant policy. Although I hope I'm wrong, at this point it is starting to feel inevitable that there will be another referendum. Though I think there is little prospect of it being adopted, I hope something like my strategy might provide a way to keep Labour relatively united, avoid alienating too many voters on either side, and prevent any serious economic damage. At the same time, it would keep open the possibility of negotiating a permanent deal which would allow a Left government to begin to challenge capitalism in the UK .

One of the most popular elements of Labour's 2017 manifesto was the pledge to return energy to public ownership . At last year's conference John McDonnell said \"Rail, water, energy, Royal Mail—we're taking them back\". This makes it sound like he's pledging to renationalise energy, but examining Labour's manifesto policies it quickly becomes clear that he is either being deliberately misleading or displaying a stunning lack of understanding of how the energy sector functions in this country. Below, I will explain how electricity was structured when it was publicly owned and how Margaret Thatcher went about privatising it. I will then examine the technical and democratic shortcomings of the electricity market which she created. (While electricity only makes up 20% of the UK 's energy use , electrifying the remaining 80% will form a key part of addressing climate change, so I will use the terms interchangeably throughout this article and have chosen not to look at gas and petrol markets.) I go on to analyse exactly what Labour has promised and lay out why their plan to move to a decentralised energy system is implausible. Finally, I will argue that we should embrace the need for national planning of the electricity sector and the centralised ownership that entails. Nationalisation and Privatisation Nationalised electricity was once the norm across much of the world and how Britain structured the industry was fairly typical. The Central Electricity Generating Board ( CEGB ) owned all power plants and the national grid. The distribution infrastructure (wires leading into people's homes) was owned by 14 area electricity boards. The CEGB was responsible for ensuring that there was always sufficient electricity supply for the country, which was bought by the area electricity boards and then sold on to customers. Scotland had a separate electricity company which handled all of generation, transmission, distribution, and sales in that jurisdiction. It was once thought that electricity was a natural monopoly, but Margaret Thatcher showed much of the sector could be \"liberalised\" to operate in a competitive environment. She split the CEGB into the national grid and three generating companies. These were sold off over a few years, along with the area electricity boards. A system was introduced by which the electricity boards purchased electricity from the generators on a national wholesale market. This was achieved through a combination of bilateral contracts, real-time bidding, and a futures market. After a transition period, retail companies were allowed into the market to compete against the area electricity boards, the latter being required to separate operation of the distribution grid from the supply of electricity. Matching electricity production to demand has gone from a technical exercise to something more like the trading floor of the stock exchange. Yet even that is not sufficient to make the grid function properly, because generators and suppliers only trade with each other to cover half-hour intervals. Demand varies on considerably shorter time scales so there must also be a \"capacity market\" through which National Grid plc pays generators to stay on standby and turn production up and down as needed. Similar markets exist for other \"ancillary services\" such as maintaining the correct voltage. If ever you need an example of the role of the state in constructing and maintaining markets, electricity is where you should look. None of this could exist if not for government regulations. Nothing that happens can be considered some sort of \"natural\" market outcome, as it is a direct consequence of the decisions the government made when it constructed the market. If the design is faulty then a serious crisis can develop. We saw this in when the Canadian province of Ontario liberalised electricity; after a few months the wholesale price climbed so high that the market had to be suspended, to be replaced by an even stranger quasi-liberalised system. A much more serious case was the Enron scandal in California, where companies manipulated the market to boost profits, causing blackouts. The Inevitability of Planning Beyond this, there is one fundamental problems of electricity markets: they are really terrible at getting sufficient investment. The old vertically-integrated companies used to simply forecast demand and build accordingly, setting rates to cover cost. In a liberalised electricity market, generators have to hope that they can supply at the wholesale price, without being certain what that price will be in 10, 20, or 50 years' time. In practice, building new power plants has often required the government to guarantee a price for the generator. Risk has been shifted off of the utility and back onto rate-payers, which is precisely what liberalisation was supposed to avoid! This is true for conventional energy sources, but the problem becomes even worse with intermittent renewables. A wind farm on its own isn't of much use to the grid, because its output can't be set to meet demand. Somehow you need to ensure that there are sufficient other mechanisms to adjust supply and/or demand to be equal, regardless of how quickly the wind is blowing. This has been a serious problem for the government's attempts to incentivise green energy and can result in some very inefficient decisions. Fortunately, researchers at Imperial College have developed a model which can determine the cheapest combination of energy sources to achieve this \"system integration\". In a report commissioned by the Committee on Climate Change, we are told that A range of market and regulatory mechanisms and commercial arrangements exist to allocate and recover system integration costs. Ideally, such arrangements should ensure that the operational and investment decisions made by private entities achieve outcomes as close as possible to the theoretical ideal prescribed by Imperial's modelling. What is being said is that the government is trying to construct the market so that it will choose what we already know to be the optimal outcome. The absurdity of this should be apparent. The only solution is to start to move away from markets. To an extent this is acknowledged in an independent report to the government proposing a set of reforms . In simple terms, these would see the national transmission grid operator putting contracts out to tender for new generating capacity, with the requirement that the winner be able to meet certain levels of demand when needed. The generating company would then be responsible for getting the correct mix of generation, storage infrastructure, and demand management to achieve this, likely via subcontracting. What we would see, then, is the nation's electricity supply being planned in little pieces. The problem is not the presence of planning, per se , but the fact that it is being done by unaccountable private firms. The piecemeal nature also prevents economies of scale, leading to more expensive electricity. Similarly, it is likely that by planning the grid as a whole we could arrive at a more optimal solution than planning it as many small units ( as critics of the report have noted ). Labour's Unfocused Vision \" What does all of this have to do with Labour?\" I hear you cry. \"Didn't they promise to nationalise the Big 6?\" While last year's manifesto was often reported that way (including in a breathless Momentum email after it was leaked), no such promises were made. We are told that Labour will \"regain control of energy supply networks through the alteration of operator license conditions, and transition to a publicly owned, decentralised energy system.\" The following steps are laid out to achieve this: Regaining control of energy supply networks through the alteration of the National and Regional Network Operator license conditions. Supporting the creation of publicly owned, locally accountable energy companies and co-operatives to rival existing private energy suppliers, with at least one in every region. Legislating to permit publicly owned local companies to purchase the regional grid infrastructure, and to ensure that national and regional grid infrastructure is brought into public ownership over time. The only nationalisation mentioned here is of the grid, and this is only \"over time\". Any energy retailers will have to compete against the Big 6. Given that \"Labour understands that many people don't have time to shop around, they just want reliable and affordable energy\", it is exceptionally odd that their solution is to create a seventh choice in the market. Strikingly, absolutely nothing is said about electricity generation . No commitments are made to buy out existing power plants and only vague statements are given on ownership of new infrastructure. We are told that Labour supports new projects such as carbon capture and storage, renewables, and nuclear, but not who will own them. The accompanying report on industrial strategy commits to \"support local renewable energy generation\" but doesn't define what this means. Could \"local\" include ownership by small businesses? Would that be any more democratic that ownership by the Big 6? The report also pledges to continue to support private development of schemes such as the Swansea tidal lagoon, Hinckley C, and a potential nuclear power plant at Moorside. Offshore wind development is endorsed, but no clue is given over ownership, especially considering no one is particularly \"local\" to an offshore wind farm. Labour has also spoken about encouraging the installation of solar panels on houses. This idea is technically, socially, and ideologically unsound. As George Monbiot explains , it is technically unsound because solar panels produce the most electricity in the summer and the middle of the day, and little or none at periods of peak demand. It is socially unsound because it means that those people sufficiently well-off to own a house are given generous subsidies for solar panels, paid for by higher energy bills for everyone else. And it is ideologically unsound because it represents a petty-bourgeois, individualised vision of addressing climate change, in which power production becomes a literal cottage industry for which households must take personal responsibility. Being charitable, it sounds like Labour wants to support the development of cooperative and local-authority owned renewable energy sources, rather than seeking national ownership. This is similar to the approach promoted by the We Own It campaign and by David Hall of the University of Greenwich. They point to the success of existing supply companies like Robin Hood Energy (owned by Nottingham City Council) and to Germany where \"council owned energy companies supply around half of the market\". They are also enthusiastic about the \"democratic\" system of numerous small, locally controlled energy companies which will bring the \"clean, green, decentralised energy future we need\". It is very odd that public suppliers competing with private ones is the model offered here, given that most on the Left would reject that as a half-measure if proposed for the railways. Competition would probably require the continued operation of the electricity market. It would certainly prevent full public control over tariff structures, as anything which benefits the poor at the expense of the rich or households at the expense of business would simply cause the worse-off party to switch to a competitor. If we really want to meet people's desire for \"reliable and affordable energy\" without them having to \"shop around\", it would be better to have a single supply company in any given area, which also operates the distribution grid. This would likely be more efficient than the competitive market, as it would prevent needless duplication, advertising, and the bureaucracy needed to switch suppliers. However, what I find truly bizarre about these proposals is that Left-wing people are advocating for energy co-ops. In most sectors, a co-operative is owned by its employees or its customers. In rural parts of North America there do exist electricity supply consumer co-operatives, but this is not what people are talking about here. Instead, locals would become members of the co-operative by paying to finance new energy projects. Given how energy is regulated, it is impossible for them to then buy their power from the co-op, so instead it sells its power into the market and returns the profits to its investors as dividends. These are fairly generous dividends at that: the Brighton Energy Co-operative aims to make a 5% return on investment each year, which is substantially higher than the cost of servicing public-sector borrowing. Whatever their talk of \"community ownership\", energy co-ops would appear to have far more in common with Margaret Thatcher's \"share-owning democracy\" than with socialism. We should be seeking to sell energy at cost, rather than use energy bills as a way to pay a low-risk, comfortable rate of return to middle class people looking for a feel-good investment. We certainly should not make participation in decision-making around energy contingent on being able to pay £300 to buy shares (the minimum purchase for the Brighton Energy Co-operative). The Localist Fantasy Even leaving co-ops of this sort aside and assuming that local authorities will own the generators, there are evident problems with Labour's policies. The market is never mentioned here and no proposals are made for reforms. We are not told how these new democratic energy companies will interact with each other and with the existing private components of the market. It is implied that energy will increasingly be generated locally, allowing for easy democratic control and bypassing the market. To the extent that energy needs to be imported from elsewhere, we are forced to conclude it will be sourced from the energy market more-or-less as it exists now. This is a problem. Few places in the UK will ever be self-sufficient in energy. To generate, on average, 50GW of electricity from wind (this being roughly equal to current peak demand, which will only grow as we phase out gas and petrol) would require covering about 10% of the country in wind farms. That might not sound like a huge amount, but considering that only 6% of the UK is \"built upon\" , the scale of the task quickly becomes apparent. Most people live in cities, where there is simply not enough room for much energy generation to be \"local\" to them. It gets worse. Those who are against tackling climate change often ask \"what happens when the wind isn't blowing?\" Though arguing in bad faith, they make a valid point. There is an issue of \"intermittency\" in wind, solar, wave, and (to a lesser extent) tidal power. When these sources are part of a broader mix then other power plants can easily adjust their output to take the load. However, what happens if half of your power comes from intermittent sources? What if it's 100%? What's left to take the load? In countries without massive hydroelectric or geothermal resources it's not clear that 100% renewable energy is even possible. One of the answers put forward to address this is the \"European super-grid\", connecting renewable resources in different countries so, e.g., Danish wind could provide power to the UK when it is calm over Britain, and vice versa. This could certainly help with the worst lulls, although considerable variability remains . Regardless, the requirement for not only a national grid but a continental one clearly cuts against the argument that we can have local energy. We also hear about the potential of different storage technologies. If we're being honest, the only one of these which might be able to work on a sufficient scale is pumped-hydro, which can only operate in certain areas and thus is inherently non-local for most people. There are suggestions about a \"smart-grid\" which can adjust demand to meet supply, but this could only be a part of the solution and would therefore have to work on the (supra-)national scale. Maybe we could make everything work if different renewable energy and storage infrastructure is carefully selected and sited to compliment each other, but who is going to coordinate this in a decentralised system? We'd be back to the current problem of trying to plan the market. Even leaving the issue of coordination aside, in practice this model leaves much to be desired. In principle, all of the wind-farms, dams, solar panels, etc. could be publicly owned by different local authorities. They could then trade electricity on the national market, much as happens between the Big 6 now. However, we're quickly losing any semblance of local control and accountability, with electricity coming from the National Grid, purchased on a contract with who-knows which generating company, who may well have subcontracted to another company. Gaps would be filled by hedging and buying on the spot market. The local supply companies would only be able to choose from what is available on the market and generating companies would only be able to build what they think they could sell. This market mediation would seriously encumber democratic decision making. \" Local\" is not a Synonym for \"Democracy\" I do not see any way to have significant local ownership of energy production without a national electricity market and all of the insanity that entails. It would be much more transparent and easier to understand if we were to develop a national plan for energy (with local consultation, of course). Generation and transmission would be owned by a single national Power Generation Board. Distribution and retail could, if desired, operate on a regional or local level, leaving some room for local input into exact tariff structures. The downside to this is that people in low density areas (with greater infrastructure requirements) will likely end up paying more than those in big cities. In any case, the big decisions about what sort of energy we want and where to build the infrastructure are inherently national in scale. The Left needs to face the fact that only a centralised model for generation is likely to achieve the economies of scale and capacity for planning which we will need to get ourselves off of fossil fuels. Despite the obvious risk that such a centralised institution would be aloof from local concerns, the improved transparency of decision-making would still make this the more democratic approach. Indeed, conflation of \"democratic\" with \"local\" is something we should be suspicious of. Certainly local control has its place, but that does not mean it is the best choice in all cases. We need to examine what we mean when we say something is \"democratic\", as was argued in an article surveying Germany's famous Energiewende (the name for their attempted move towards renewable energy): It is interesting the way in which the language of German environmentalism has become incorporated into an Australian environmentalist narrative… [It] was the German [solar energy feed-in-tariff] model that became the template for small-scale support mechanisms from the 1990s. This became aligned with the concept of democratised energy, which was imported into Australia via green groups and solar advocates. What makes the democracy idea interesting in an Australian context is that there is little precedent for the concept in relation to utilities and public services—indeed, Australians generally express a preference for socialised public services (such as Medicare)… It is easier for a household to go \"off-grid\" for their water supply, for example, yet nobody discusses \"the suburban democratisation of water\"…. In contrast, the democratisation of personal transport—motor cars—is strongly critiqued by green groups in favour of the socialised model of urban transport—trains and public transport. So we can see that the \"democratised\" model is really an opportunistic use of language—democracy is adopted as a universal virtue and associated with a value-laden cause, rather than representing a coherent argument. One can see parallels and similar inconsistencies in this country. For example, the Left favours national management of the NHS , feeling this to be more accountable and thus \"democratic\". Yet, for some reason, a fragmented and competitive system is viewed as \"democratic\" in energy despite it bearing more resemblance to the present Health and Social Care Act than the vision of the NHS Reinstatement Bill . So, what do we actually mean by democracy? To me, it means that everyone who is affected by a decision should be involved in the decision. Some issues will inherently involve vast numbers of people and therefore must be dealt with on that scale. Energy is one example of this. Desire to cut oneself off from other people and be totally self-sufficient is a hallmark of the lunatic fringe of the Right. Human beings are social creatures who depend upon each other for survival. As socialists we acknowledge and embrace this, fighting for the system managing these inter-dependencies to be fair, transparent, and democratic. If we want a democratic energy system, then we must abolish the electricity market and embrace the accountable, centralised control that entails, rather than retreat into conservative fantasies of local self-reliance.","tags":"Energy Electricity British Politics Nationalisation Planning","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/ownership-and-markets-in-energy.html","title":"Ownership and Markets in Energy"},{"text":"The agenda for this meeting was approved. The anti-semitism motion ws deffered until next meeting (see below). The minutes for the February AMM were approved with minor corrections. AGM minutes are approved next year but a brief review was given. Matters Arising and Urgent Business None. Local Elections Gained ground among young voters and Greens, while Lib Dem vote went up in some of the more affluent area. Lost one seat to the Lib Dems. Lots of thanks for door-knockers, etc. More wards were campaigned in and more new candidates put forward than ever before. Best ever result since current wards were created and have highest share of council seats ever. Campaign organiser has been offered a permanent position. Increased ethnic diversity and number of people with disability on the council, while number of women stayed the same. In Kidlington the Lib Dems and Greens teemed up which cost us some. Was an issue with housing where Greens said nothing in the greenbelt, full stop, whereas Labour was more pragmatic. The Green position was more popular locally. Cherry suggested we may be able to start making progress in Oxford West and Abingdon, having won a seat there for the first time. In North ward Oxford sent long letters whereas Lib Dems had shorter and more memorable leaflets. Housing is important to keep campaigning on, as that's what wins in many areas (even Tories had to pay lip service to it). Asked for posters explaining why people do telling so people realise why they're being asked how they vote and that this means they won't be bothered later by door-knockers. Mentioned that Lib Dems are really good self-publicists and their leaflets can make a really big difference. In particular, they are very professional looking. Parliamentary Report Long printed report was provided (as it has been two months since the last one). Spring Statement (talking about state of the economy) happened which showed that austerity has not worked, long term problems persist, growth rates have to be adjusted down, growth rates poorer than other countries, etc. Labour argues government should look at these stats and reverse course. Should remove changes to banking levy (which returns money to profitable banks) and use money for children's services. 1/3 of councils are saying they can not properly provide these statutory services. Want government to look at funds for local government which have been slashed (claiming they can always raise council tax, despite them then campaigning against Labour on this basis). Wrong decision to cut stamp duty for first time buyers, because without more houses all it does is push up prices. Now need to develop a more detailed Labour policy on housing (one has now been released—I remember seeing some on the Left being disappointed by it). Wants a local event to get people's expertise involved. Managed to get a win on tax transparency for overseas territories. Will mean transparent property registers will now be required, allowing us to see what oligarchs own things where. Was a Customs Union vote in Parliament, which passed unanimously (because Tories boycotted, knowing they would loose—similar thing happened on Universal Credit). Government is ignoring it. MPs insist some electronics at the border can sort it out. Cuts to HMRC would make it very difficult to implement new customs control as well. She knew of Windrush, having helped some constituents with it. Have managed to get some people out of trouble, but setting up a special surgery to try to get in contact with everyone . Want an enquiry to find out exactly how this happened, who's been deported, etc. Treasury team is trying to develop the plans for government and this will continue over summer. Locally she hopes we can develop links with other councils and constituencies to help more marginal areas get elected. Question on whether the finance team could try to come up with ways to continue the Iran agreement without (in spite of) US . Alternative currencies to buy oil? Emily Thornberry spoke very harshly about it and we should continue to support it but need to think in practical terms. Banks are nervous about having activity in countries with US sanctions. Anneliese will try to raise the issue in Parliament. I asked about member involvement in policy formation. Deferred to Ann on NPF process. Shadow Treasury policy making does have various events which can be attended. Will be a state of the economy event next Friday. Mentioned that manifesto was popular so feels there is a mandate to develop that further, but member consultation obviously needed when new directions taken. Ann agreed that NPF documents were not useful but pledged to improve things as newly elected chair. Someone asked about children denied free school meals if in immigrant family. Labour government on these issues and how government accounting works in this regard. Question on what Labour will do to commemorate anniversary of Grenfell. Planning is underway on this. Wants to focus on changing the system so fire can't happen again and survivors will be properly looked after. Government not giving straight answers on fire regulations and whether they apply to private housing. Also refusing to pay councils that have replaced flammable cladding. Someone asked what an adequate response to Windrush would be. Compensation is being mentioned, but that doesn't seem sufficient. No one listened to those speaking out about the issue and it took investigative journalists to bring it out. Referenced a few good speeches in Parliament we should listen to (David Lamb, Dianne Abbott, someone else). Reports of how awful and arbitrary the Home Office is. Any compensation will have to cover less tangible losses (health, broken families, etc.). Most important thing is to find out how it happened and make sure Amber Rudd isn't just the scapegoat. It was Theresa May who was the architect of the system and she seems to be getting away with it. Oxford East NPF Tom Hayes (not the Momentum candidate) won the vote 26-13. Party Democracy Review A report from the meeting we had on Part II of the review was submitted to the party. We broke into groups to discuss electing the leadership (from party 3 of the review). We were given a set of questions to consider. There were a couple, for if we had the time, dealing with the NEC . However, there is absolutely no mention of policy formation. Ann explained that this is because it's something most people understand and there are a small number of finite options on which we can vote. Groups will discuss it and propose any other options they can think of after we reconvene, then vote on it. In the meeting we decided on: OMOV , with some people emphasising the role for trade unionists A percentage of MPs/CLPs with CLPs having equivalent status Overall voted against registered supporters 33-24 (didn't split cleanly along left/right lines) No vote on how much registered supporters pay, due to previous Multiple suggestions that only those who were members when leadership election called should vote in it, which ultimately won 39-19 (latter for no qualifying period) Surprised to see John Tanner opting for the less democratic choices. Motions Trans women and all-women shortlists The motion we passed at SWC branch finally came to the debate. John Tanner spoke for it as proposer. Liz seconded and also spoke, emphasising we want to forward it to the relevant section of the party. Ann said NEC will be trying to come up with new wording to satisfy all involved. She will take the motion to the meeting in the spirit it was submitted. Two spoke in support, none against. Passed unanimously. Anti-semitism motion Ann felt there were so many amendments to (each different) that it was worth passing it back to the proposers and the amenders, to try to get it reformed and with no more than two amendments. We will vote on it next time. The party's General Secretary sent some guiding notes to all CLP secretaries for discussing this topic. Executive Committee Report We received minutes from the last EC meeting. Stephen Marks announced an economics day school on 23 June, which is mentioned in the minutes. Will be looking at childcare as a generator of jobs and the topic of precarious work. Agreed next meeting will be on 14th June (in Abingdon) and then 13th of July.","tags":"Labour Party British Politics Meetings","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/oxford-district-labour-party-amm-may-2018.html","title":"Oxford & District Labour Party AMM May 2018"},{"text":"For some time I've been curious about what's been happening with of the Left-supported social democratic government in Portugal. It struck me as the best argument against my suspicion that a classical social democratic government are not possible within capitalism today. This was brought to the fore the other day when a Portuguese member of the Labour Party in Oxford posted a link on the local Momentum Facebook group to a pamphlet called The Portuguese Government Solution: The \"Fourth Way\" to Social-Democratic Politics? . This was produced by a European social democratic think-tank ( FEPS —Foundation for European Progressive Studies) looking at the model provided by the Socialist Party government in Portugal and suggesting this shows \"that there is a way for these parties to reaffirm a left-wing agenda within the EU \". Catarina Martins and prime minister António Costa, leaders of the Portuguese radical left party Bloco de Esquerda and the social democratic Socialist Party, respectively. The document explains how in 2015 the right wing government which had been pursuing fierce austerity lost its overall majority in parliament (while still remaining the largest party). The Socialist Party ( PS ) chose not to support them or to enter a grand coalition, instead opting to form a minority government with the support of the radical Bloco de Esquerda (Left Bloc) and the orthodox Communist Party of Portugal (as well as the latter's close allies, the Greens). While there were large areas of disagreement between these parties, they were able to unite around policies which reversed course on austerity while respecting EU rules. Representatives of PS say that this was largely consistent with what they had run on in the election, except with the implementation of some policies accelerated. They have since celebrated the success of this government, claiming it has functioned far more smoothly than anyone expected. The economy has started growing again while the deficit has fallen to within EU -sanctioned levels. The government is popular, with support for PS growing significantly and support for the juniour partners staying relatively stable. I had read a fair bit about the situation in Portugal when this government was formed in late 2015, but had not heard much since. Nonetheless, much of what I was now reading ran counter to the more critical line I remembered coming from members of Bloco. As such, I read the report with a great deal of scepticism. One thing which I noticed, in particular, was how modest most of the measures enacted by the government were. By and large, they were simply reversing some of the worst policies of the previous government, doing little to actually implement new progressive measjres. Personally, I would question whether that really amounts to a repudiation of the Third Way and a return to social democracy's roots, as the PS claims. I was very interested to hear Bloco's side of the story. I started by rereading some of the material produced in 2015 . These contradcited on a number of assertions made by the FEPS report, starting with the idea that the PS had campaigned on ending austerity. Bloco members claimed that PS had run a contradictory campaign and ran on policies similar to those of their right wing opponents. As such, it was initially expected that they would support a minority right wing government. In fact, it seems to be a running theme that Bloco was overly pessimistic about the prospects for a left government. They didn't expect PS to be interested in trying to build one, then they didn't expect PS to agree to their demands, and then they assumed that fulfilling even these modest demands would quickly require defying EU budgetary rules and collapse the government. In all of this they have been proven wrong. What I really wanted to learn, though, was how the situation had progressed since then. Unfortunately, much of the international left-wing websites are very good about reporting on developments when something exciting like an election happen, while very bad at letting us know what actually comes of those events. After a bit of digging I found an interview with Bloco's leader , Catarina Martins, from sometime last year. While published in German, Google Translate proved sufficiently advanced for me to get a good grasp of what was said. It is clear that Martins views the government's achievements as extremely limited. She points out that most of what it has done has simply been to stop the implementation of new austerity and reverse some of what had already been applied, as I noted earlier. She does not consider Portugal to have a left government, as action has been woefully inadequate to address the deep problems facing the country and been unable to undo the effects of austerity. This was an interesting corrective, but didn't provide the deep level of analysis I was looking for to contrast with the The Portuguese Government Solution . After some rooting around on the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung website, I eventually found an English-language report written by Bloco and Die Linke activist Catarina Príncipe (whom I hold in high regard as a leftist commentator). This report, titled Anti-Austerity and the Politics of Toleration in Portugal: A way for the Radical Left to develop a transformative project? explains the government experience from Bloco's point of view; indeed, although I am not certain of this, possibly from the perspective of someone on the left of Bloco. This report provides background on the pre-2015 political situation in Portugal which complements that of FEPS . Once again, Príncipe emphasised how Bloco had not expected a deal to be reached to support a PS government. As such, they were on the back foot during negotiations. Claims by the PS that they had always supported many of policies demanded by the left parties are cast into doubt. Príncipe suggests that many of these they were pushed by Bloco and the Communists against great resistance from PS . While the government has introduced some progressive measures, it was pointed out that Bloco has not been completely successful in preventing new privatisation, particularly of banks which were bailed out by the state at massive cost to the public purse. Though not stated outright, other reading I have done suggests that EU pressure contributed to those privatisations. It is noted that the EU demanded new cuts in some areas to offset increased social spending, while NATO insisted on an increase in the military budget. Príncipe also present a considerably less optimistic view of the state of the economy in Portugal. She points out that while the revival is partially due to citizens now having more spending power, it is also heavily dependent on external factors such as an increase in tourism and the low price of oil. Crucially, it is the result of unused economic capacity being utilised once again and not of new investment. In an interview (starts at 24:56) she says that public investment is extremely low, with the funds instead being used for increases in current expenditure. Likewise, there has been little investment in the private sector. This contradicts claims made in the FEPS report, although some of their investment figures are in terms of year-on-year percent increases and could be hiding a very low starting point. Príncipe feels that the lack of investment and precarious state of the financial sector leaves Portugal's economy vulnerable. Should there be a new downturn or crisis, she predicts that the PS and the EU will quickly insist on the return to austerity in order to balance budgets. Of course, she had also predicted that they would not agree even to their current policy. The report ends with an assessment of Bloco's strategy, as well as some notes on the relation of the Left to the EU . While acknowledging that Bloco had little choice but to support the PS government, Príncipe is clearly uncomfortable with parts of the direction her party has taken. At times this comes across quite clearly in the above-mentioned interview. She believes the party must be reoriented away from an overly parliamentary focus and seek to build the capacity to fully challenge austerity and even capitalism. There are some areas of clear contradiction between the two accounts, particularly around the PS 's electoral campaign and levels of investment in the Portuguese economy. Not being able to read Portuguese, I'm unable to properly assess who is correct in these areas. Overall, however, I find Príncipe's account of the situation to be the more convincing one. Of course, that may just be because it agrees more with my preconceived notions. So, what are the consequences for a Labour government trying to implement something like the 2017 election manifesto in the UK ? That manifesto was, after-all, essentially just a return to mild social democracy (although John McDonnell's Alternative Models of Ownership report starts to point in some more radical directions). In one regard, at least, Labour will have it easier: even in the EU , the UK retains more control of its monetary and fiscal policy than Portugal by virtue of not being in the Euro. On the other hand, there are a number of extra difficulties. For one, the PS has implemented this program with Bloco and the Communists in parliament holding their feet to the fire. Labour would have no such anti-capitalist left force keeping them accountable. On the contrary, they would have a rump of right-wing MPs who may well defy party discipline and vote against even mildly progressive measures. Labour's program would also go considerably further than what has been done in Portugal, to include much greater increases in social spending and some nationalisation. These measures are more likely to antagonise capital, with the CBI already denouncing the latter and claiming they would deter investment. Perhaps this is just an empty threat (there was plenty of such rhetoric during the formation of the PS government), but perhaps not. British capital is very powerful, after all, and has often defeated measures which its European counterparts accommodated themselves to. What's more, while the PS remains very much an establishment party whose leaders are trusted by Portuguese and European capital, the same can not be said of the current Labour leadership. As such, capital may be particularly unwilling to tolerate progressive measures coming from Corbyn and McDonnell. But most of all, we must remember how vulnerable the Portuguese government is. If Príncipe is to be believed, the economic recovery has been contingent on factors outside of their control. Should the economy sour, the entire project of \"turning the page on austerity\" would be at risk. Labour might find there is suddenly no room to implement their mild social democratic program if there is a recession in the UK . Given the sickly state of the British economy and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, a recession could certainly happen. There is no indication that the sort of soft end to austerity practised in Portugal would be able to counteract it. On the contrary, I'm inclined to believe that only a more radical left project which started to look at asserting public control over investment decisions would be able to prevent the return of austerity. So, while the Portuguese experience may suggest a bit more room for social democracy than I expected, I still don't think there is all that much.","tags":"Austerity Europe Bloco de Esquerda Socialism","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/the-implications-of-portugal-for-a-renewal-of-social-democracy.html","title":"The Implications of Portugal for a Renewal of Social Democracy"},{"text":"The agenda for this meeting was approved (with national nominations moved ahead to give extra time for counting) as were the minutes for the previous AGM . Note that votes on officers, nominations, etc. were done by branch delegates only. Full rules for the AGM were sent in advance. Matters Arising and Urgent Business None. National Nominations These were moved ahead to give more time to count ballots (unanimously approved). Late arrivals will be able to submit ballots right until the originally scheduled time. See the list of candidates to the national positions, with candidate statements and lists of those nominating them to the AGM . Treasurer's Report Had £15k more income than anticipated, due to the general election. About £5k more was spent than expected due to the election, although lost the organiser so savings on payroll. Surplus of £9000, although £3000 deferred expenditure to pay salary of organiser. Surplus largely due to large donation from a union. Projecting balanced budget for this year. Increased income donated by Labour Group of councillors. More money will be spent on conference delegates (sending two per CLP , rather than one). Want to keep things reasonably solid so can do the campaigning they want without having to worry about cost. Accounts unanimously approved. Officers' Report These reports were sent in advance (I didn't read them). The chair gave a brief summary of her report. She was pleased to fight on a \"socialist\" manifesto and see how popular it was. She was pleased at how all of the 10 key positions in the local party/government are filled by women. Thanked retiring council leader. Congratulated equalities commission and diverse slate of candidates, though we can't rest on our laurels. Talked about how to broaden support and campaign beyond canvassing. Talked about needing to be welcoming to everyone and respectful of all views. Team will try to be inclusive. Thanked Ann Black for her hard work. No objections to the reports. Amendments to Rules and Standing Orders Andrew Smith proposed changes to campaign committee , though Ann spoke on it. Only meets 3 times a year and operates on ad-hoc basis, but has become something of a club of friends. Want to formalise it. Spending decisions will be OKed by the GM . All branches will now send representatives. No questions or challenges were made and it was passed overwhelmingly. Election of Officers and Delegates We were sent a list of nominated candidates in advance. More detailed candidate statements were also provided. Almost all officer posts were uncontested. One of the challengers for the BAME Officer withdrew, so that is no longer contested (Momentum candidates winning by default). We will hear speeches from trade union officer. At least one conference delegate must be female. Conference delegates are elected by first past the post ( FPTP ). Luke Akehurst asked about run-off voting and said it should be done this way in future. Ann Black rebuked him as having ample opportunity to raise such a procedural issue and FPTP has always been used in the past so it's not like it's a surprise. Mark Ladbroke (incumbent) spoke about how trade unionists are transformative and how nice it is to be in a position which allows him to work with those who are actually fighting back. Has worked on living wage campaign, including with competitor. Said up to Peter if wants to continue working jointly with him in future. Peter Nowland who I don't recognise) said would like to work with Mark to get unions back into workplaces fighting for better conditions. Unclear whether were proposing job-sharing. Ann seemed to indicate it would be working together on a more informal basis, as they had not been nominated on a jobshare. At last minute the two candidates did agree to jobshare, so no contested positions. Couldn't be bothered to take detailed notes on conference delegate speeches. Some were obvious Corbynites, some were obvious anti-Corbynites. Most were a bit more guarded on these issues. I already knew who were the Momentum candidates. Oxford City Labour Group This report was emailed sent with the email. The council leader was here to take any questions, but there didn't appear to be any. Oxfordshire County Labour Group The report was supposed to have been sent in advance, but I couldn't find it. The leader of the group wasn't here, but a councillor was present to take questions. She started by noting that the group managed to get £500k maintained in homelessness services. Also that voted against Tory idea of giving some new central government money to councillors to administer, instead wanting it to go to children's services. Parliamentary Report Anneliese's printed report didn't seem to make it to me, somehow. She started by mentioning the Oxfam crisis, as they are a major employer in the city. Employees admitted bad mistakes were made, but expressed concern that the Right is using it as an excuse to gut foreign aid, particularly where it involves more political charities such as Oxfam. The minister claims no weaponisation of the issue, but Anneliese feels this is not her experience. Also stressed that lessons need to be learned beyond just the charity structure. Reiterated that Corbyn has committed to membership of \"a\" customs union, saying she thinks this is the right decision and what she hoped Labour would move to. Also campaigning against the government using Brexit as an attempt to grab power and avoid parliamentary scrutiny. Recently the government has tried to water down anti-money laundering laws and Anneliese thinks they might be able to pull some Tories towards them on this. Shadow treasury team is preparing for spring statement. Supposedly will be no changes to spending etc. in it, but will reveal the bad state of the economy. Tories will try to spin it as not as bad as everyone thought, but it is still bad. Hoping can use this as an opportunity to push them on council funding. Cuts to taxes benefiting companies and the rich were made at the same time council funding was drastically cut. Those decisions will have long-term costs for our communities. John Tanner asked when Labour will come out in favour of single market membership. Anneleise felt the UK will be \"rule-takers\" whether in single market or not. Seems to indicate single market membership is her preferred option. Someone else asked whether the number of Tory councils facing bankruptcy might force the government to soften its approach. Apparently MPs are trying to bring this up with Conservatives. They just say \"councils can raise council tax\", which is cynical for obvious reasons. Would mean those on low income would be paying for central government tax. Was a question on homelessness; something about it's relation to national policy. Theresa May seemed to be trying to spin action as helping with homelessness, nut planning bill doesn't really change power imbalance between councils and developers. Trying to give free-market solutions to a problem that requires public action. Someone from student union asked about what Labour is doing locally and nationally to support UCU strike. Anneleise noted how she was a lecturer and as, a student, managed to get USS ethically invested. As such she is appalled by what UUK is doing to it now. Has been asked to sign an early day motion on this, but as a front-bencher she has to be told to do so by whips. She hopes she will be allowed to sign it soon. Someone brought up university hospitals where, in exchange for 2% pay rise for next 3 years staff are being asked not to take annual leave. This, of course, is leading to even deeper demoralisation. Labour feared this sort of thing when Tories formally removed pay cap a few months ago. In any case, that's a below-inflation pay rise. Where pay rises do occur, it seems to come out of services, but Labour has shown that cancelling tax cuts would allow everyone to have proper raises. She met with CCG recently but stressed they are between a rock and a hard place. Conservatives claiming problems in Oxford are just down to local management not adopting Tory policies is absurd. Someone pointed out lots of people are doing unpaid work already and Anneliese agreed the NHS is just running on goodwill and if there were work to rule the whole thing would fall apart. Motions Eastern Ghouta Ann acted as proposer because the proposers in the branch were absent. This was asking Corbyn to condemn Assad's action in one region. I don't know what to think of this one, given that it's a war against ISIS , etc. Someone spoke against (also did so at branch, but was caught by surprise then). He said he knows this was tabled with good intentions, but believes that in the context we should oppose it. Said Boris Johnson is threatening airstrikes in Syria and Trump wants to start a war somewhere. Had two parliamentary debates on action in Syria over last few years. This motion would help provide a pretext for western bombing. Said these are the kinds of arguments which led to disaster in Iraq and Libya. Someone said \"we need to do something\", which I find unconvincing. Another person insisted this does not provide a pretext for international intervention. Said Assad is responsible for the vast majority of civilian casualties, according to Amnesty International. Luke Akehurst said in motions we should vote for what is written on paper. No reason not to vote for calling for immediate ceasefires and humanitarian corridors. Only military intervention mentioned in motion is that of Russia. Someone claimed motion is completely unbalanced for condemning what Russia is doing but not Al Queda for controlling regions and refusing to let civilians leave. Felt is was one-sided because of this. Didn't count number in favour. 11 against and \"more than a dozen abstentions\". I abstained, feeling I had insufficient knowledge to judge. Passed overwhelmingly. I couldn't quite tell, but I think some Momentum members voted for. NHS Jane Stockton spoke as mover for this, noting that she hopes it isn't controversial. Calls on party at local level to act against 5 year plan for NHS and introduction of \"accountable care organisations\". Labour-controlled bodies mentioned in the motion, such as the city council, have the power to call for changes to be halted and reviewed at a higher level. This is in line with national policy. We need to act now to prevent damage being done before Labour makes it into power. In other areas nearby we have seen such action be successful. Have failed to halt privatisation and downgrades, so must do more. A speaker (consultant at the hospitals) emphasised that narrative we hear of needing to carry out central government policy is false. In other areas there has been management resistance, but needs to be popular pressure. No one wanted to speak against. Passed unanimously. Immigration This motion called for proper debate in the party on immigration and the different types of immigration. Was based on a discussion in the branch. Couldn't really do a complicated issue like this through a simple motion. Want to use leavers of the party ( NPF , etc.) to get a proper discussion going, with goal of bringing something to Conference in 2019. Pointed out that for most people immigration is a secondary issue. Speaker says Labour should be a party that welcomes immigrants, but need a proper policy on it. Someone spoke against language which suggests good immigrants and bad immigrants and proposed that sentence be removed. Another felt motion was poorly worded, unclear, and can reproduce negative ideas on UK . Pointed out a number of problematic sentences. Felt motion emphasised what is good for country (vague) but not what's good for immigrants. Said language of compassion is in contradiction with continuing to support border regimes. Wants to have free movement (what with \"migration crisis\") paid for by taxing the global rich. More people wanted to speak against, but standing orders seemed to require any additional speakers to be in favour for reasons of balance. In the end, John Tanner asked for motion to be returned to branch to remove problematic wording. This was accepted. Results of Elections and Nominations For Oxford East conference delegates there was a 3-way tie between Becky, Dan, and Marie, so we had to do a revote. Results were somewhat delayed as they were not finished yet. While we waited we heard from the taxi driver (can't remember name and don't see it written down) who was fired for being a trade union shop steward. Reported on how his tribunal over this was a failure. Will be launching an appeal. Both CLPs nominated the entire left slate for NEC (plus Ann Black). Oxford East for NPF had 3 of the left slate but a recount is needed for the last one (youth is uncontested). West NPF nominations were also left slate. Oxford East conference delegates: Becky and a tie between Dan and Marie. There was a runoff, but at the end of the meeting there was still a tie. Since some delegates had left by the, the GM decided (by popular request) to look at whether they could afford to send all 3. In West, at least one and possibly both of the Momentum candidates were chosen as delegates. I missed this result on the night but I found out the next day that bot CLPs voted against nominating an NCC candidate. Only a candidate from the right was on the ballot, so this is what Momentum wanted in order that we'll have a chance to nominate someone from the left at the next meeting. We were sent official results the next day.","tags":"Labour Party British Politics Meetings","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/oxford-district-labour-party-agm-2018.html","title":"Oxford & District Labour Party AGM 2018"},{"text":"Minutes of last meeting were approved, as was the agenda for this meeting . At start of the meeting we had to decide whether to debate a motion on the NHS or on Haringey (both submitted by the same branch). Haringey was selected. Giampi Alhadeff, Speaking on Brexit General secretary of the European Parliamentary Labour Party. Started with lots of waffle, country divided, etc. Identified 4 issues: The union of the UK (due to the Northern Ireland situation), especially with the Good Friday agreement. Jobs and prosperity. Was at lots of WTO summits (including Seattle) and the negotiators are tough. Trade with other countries will hurt British sectors, losing jobs. Can't make up EU trade with overseas trade. Any international business will move out (according to Japanese Ambassador) Health & safety, workers' rights, and the environment. This is what the right-wingers talk about when they mean \"red tape\". Want a Singapore for European (which won't happen, but anyway). UK will diverge with EU as latter introduces new laws. Big issues facing the world: China developing internationally, Russia and its meddling abroad, climate change, artificial intelligence (peace, business, war, etc.) Leaving the EU will impact the UK 's ability to deal with these issues. It will address them but the UK won't have a voice. Problem for Labour is 2/3 or members want to remain while 2/3 of constituencies want to leave. He believes Labour must say that regions which voted leave will be hit hardest, so let's remain. Brexit Motion A range of views on this. I pointed out some of the downsides of the EU . It was amended to remove the talk of a second referendum. The motion now reads \"This meeting believes that the Labour Party's policy on Brexit should be to remain in the Customs Union\". This was overwhelmingly carried with about 17 votes against and 15 abstentions. Many questioned what the point of the motion was given that the customs union doesn't exist as an institution. Liz noticed that a lot of Momentum people voted for the motion. Parliamentary Report from Anneliese Dodds Praised that we had such a passionate but still civil debate on Brexit. Thinks party should press harder on the customs union issue because government is currently week on that, especially with the EU expressing doubts about the whole situation in Ireland. Has been arguing in parliament to support at least a and possibly the customs union so that Tories will split on it. Also wants to maintain unity, as election could be coming earlier than expected. Managed to get a vote against a tax treaty rejected, as these are used for tax avoidance (in the guise of international aid). A few similar bills which were coming up seem to have vanished… Also pushing transparency for trust. Other EU countries are coming out against that but not the UK . The lack of transparency is abused for money laundering, etc. Dealing with some tax issues, particularly how raising the income tax threshold has not (as the government likes to pretend) solved poverty. Cuts to benefits have had a much bigger impact. Pushing on the NHS as the winter crisis is far worse than in previous years. Sent out an emergency budget for health which showed where money could be found to help address these issues. Managed to get a requirement that homes be fit for habitation, now need to make sure tenants can actually exercise those rights. Some discussion of Helen and Douglas House (a local hospice). It seems to be having to close a lot of services because there is no public money going into it. Talk about trying to get the CCG to reconsider given the situation. Meeting gave unanimous permission to send a letter in our name. Motions Afrin Materials were circulated about this. Basically this is Turkey attacking the Kurdish, YPG -controlled areas in northern Syria. Lots of war crimes, civilian deaths, targeting of women. No one from international community has spoken up, so the drafter put forward this motion. Turkey seems to be trying to annex and ethnically cleanse it. Boris Johnson has effectively supported the invasion saying Turkey has a right to keep its borders secure. Emotional pleas to help. One speaker checked to ensure her ammendment noting how the UK is a NATO member was included (it was) and anther spoke in favour. The motion was unanimously carried. Haringey and the NEC Pointed out how HDV is a continuation of the disastrous privatisation agenda which Labour now opposes. Haringey's attempt at the HDV split the council and went against CLPs, MPs, unions. NEC intervened on behalf of councillors and union members in a very measured manner. This was all within party rules. Critics have gained massive coverage in the media, so important to put our views forward. Dan seconded and drew attention to how broad the opposition to the HDV is. Motion through the NEC was unanimously supported (after an amendment). Luke Akehurst spoke against, claiming not because he supported HDV but because the it fell within spectrum of allowable policies to be decided on a local level. Nonetheless seemed to speak in support of the HDV . Claims new council houses, even under Labour, will be built privately. Another person said it wasn't our place to stick the oar in. Others pointed out that our council leader was one of those condemning the NEC , making it our business. Overwhelmingly carried with 6 against and 20 abstentions. Rough sleeping Cherry informed me a row is brewing over the provision of this to open shelters when even one night is predicted to be below freezing (rather than 3 consecutive nights). The Labour Club says won't support any candidates failing to support this, while the council is saying won't support candidates who are in favour of it. Momentum councillors (and prospective councillors) are willing to break rank on this, but best to get this through at the CLP level to try to force council's hand. Richard presented the Southwest Central motion on rough sleeping. Made a positive case for it, emphasised working with council, not trying to be confrontational. A Momentum member (forgotten her name) proposed ammendments supporting rights of \"non-statutory homeless\" and civil rights of homeless, which Richard accepted. These were accepted. Deputy-leader of the council spoke. Says will be a church open for rough sleepers every night through January to March. To date have had enough capacity. Says SWEP is inefficient way of doing things and could make it difficult to extend current scheme. Will still vote for motion, but shouldn't get too caught up on SWEP . Unanimously carried. Executive Committee Report We were sent the full report in advance. Advertised dinner with Keir Starmer. Unfair dismissal rally tomorrow in support of GMB taxi drivers, marching from city council to Osney. Speakers on Afrin offering to speak at branch meetings. Finally, were some forms to join Labour Movement for Europe (I did not sign up). NEC Report Left as had to leave to let cold weather shelters set up.

First I travelled from the UK to a conference and then home to Canada for Christmas. Oh flying… There have been some many advances in the last few years. You arrive at the airport to be greeted by friendly staff who quickly and efficiently check your suitcases. Because you got there ahead of schedule, you're offered a seat on an earlier flight which you happily accept. You enjoy quick lines heading through security to sit down in a comfortable chair to wait to board. On the plain you stow your carry-on in the ample space and settle down into a roomy, state-of-the-art seat with ample leg-room, specifically designed to make it easy to sleep. Flight attendants offer you drinks and take you through the gourmet menu for the trip. As you take off you look through the large selection of complimentary entertainment options which will keep you occupied throughout the flight. You arrive at your destination rested and well-fed and give the crew a genuine thanks for the service. Lines at border control are short and your luggage arrives at the carousel immediately. Of course, for most of us this description could hardly be more different from our actual travel experience. In fairness, in-flight entertainment has massively improved, even for economy passengers, at least on some airlines. And many airports do have very efficient check-in or security systems (although I don't think I can come up with one which has both of these). However, by and large, only those people who inexplicably manage to end up in business class (tickets for which tend to be at least 4 times more expensive than economy) have the sort of experience I described. There has always been business class service which offers a better experience for those able to pay, but in the past both the price and service differentials were smaller. Over the past decade ore two we have seen massive strides forward in business and first class service: priority lines to go through security, priority lines to go through border control (and believe me, for a non- EU traveller in Heathrow this is a big benefit), noise-cancelling headphones, seats which convert into lie-flat beds, premium airline lounges at an ever-larger number of destinations, the list goes on. Airlines show luxurious pictures of these facilities in their marketing, despite the fact that only a tiny percentage of passengers will ever get to use them. As for the rest of us… Fees have been added to services which used to be included in the ticket price, such as having the ability to change flights, choosing your seats, checking bags, having a pillow on board, and being served a meal. On those flights where complimentary food is served, meal size and quality has gone down dramatically. Discount airlines go even further, charging for such luxuries as a carry-on bag and printing a physical boarding pass. Seats remain essentially unchanged from 40 years ago except that legroom has decreased and, on some of the big planes, they've gotten narrower thanks to the addition of an extra one in each row. In-flight service is offered is slower and less efficient than before, with the number of flight attendants cut. Fare structures have become increasingly incomprehensible and it has gotten even more difficult to accumulate enough frequent-flyer miles to be treated with some baseline level of decency. These changes also have a toll on operational efficiency. For example, with so many people now carrying luggage on board, flights are delayed as people fight for space in overhead bins and staff find themselves having to police carry-on allowances. What we've seen is ever-increasing inequality in air travel. The rich get richer with new perks and amenities. On some airlines this is taken to truly ludicrous levels, with the offering of limousine service to first class passengers and exclusive terminals. The poor get poorer with fewer and fewer services offered and more and more ancillary charges. Some argue that service may have declined but at least flying is cheaper than ever. I'm not so sure. I strongly suspect that if you included all of the extra fees needed to get what used to be standard levels of service and ticket flexibility then tickets would be as expensive as ever. Just as economic inequality has grown over the past 30 years, so too has inequality in air travel. I expect there is a causal link here. As some people have become fantastically wealthy they have gained the means to float through airports in their exclusive bubble of privilege. Meanwhile, as the incomes of most people have stagnated or declined, we're stuck with lousy service. But in addition to direct causality, I believe these trends share a common source. Both have their origins in neoliberalism. On the one hand, this resulted in a weakened labour movement, a strengthened capitalist class, a rise in outsourcing, and a reduced social wage, preventing most people from sharing in the gains of growth. On the other hand, it has resulted in privatisation and deregulation of airlines and airports, as well as increased international competition from open sky agreements. Neoliberalism helped ruin flying. Let's fight back! Nationalise the airways! Fewer seats, more leg room, cheaper tickets for all! Eliminate economy class! Would that it were that simple. There is no way that flying would be affordable for the great majority of people if everyone had current first/business class seating. There will always be a tension between making flying cheap for everyone and making it of decent quality of everyone. Furthermore, flying is a major source of greenhouse gases and one without any immediate prospect of fixing. Ecologically, it is currently in our interest to cram as many people into an airplane as possible, while ensuring that as few airplanes are flying as possible. By all means, nationalise and merge the airlines. It would allow national planning and optimisation of the network as a whole, along with a greater choice of flights. There would no longer be a need to introduce hidden fees so as to appear cheaper than the competition. We could restore a number of services which are relatively inexpensive and have little environmental impact. But we must not build our transport policy on simple populist grounds. Where practical, we'll have to replace flying with rail, which is more comfortable anyway. We'll also have to research alternatives to jet fuel. Meanwhile, let's equalise the flying experience! Strip out the absurd first class seats and give a little bit more space in economy. Bring back decent in-flight meals (with real table-wear, please!), a complimentary checked bag, pillows and blankets on short haul flights, and hot towel service. Invest some R&D into making economy seats more comfortable while still affordable. Get rid of priority lines at airports and bring in some extra staff so that everyone can be processed efficiently and make the seats by the gates a bit more comfortable. Perhaps under fully automated luxury communism everyone will experience first class levels of comfort. Until then, let's at least eliminate the inequities of flying and make flying under socialism a vaguely human experience.","tags":"Inequality Politics Flying Airlines","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/inequality-is-in-the-air.html","title":"Inequality is in the Air"},{"text":"Agreed on minutes of last meeting and the agenda for this meeting . We were also provided with the minutes for the last EC meeting . Oxfordshire county Labour group report Noted massive cuts to council funding. Makes things very difficult. However, noted one major success of reversing an outsourcing contract (with company called Carillion). Working to get home care, school meals, etc. back in house. Trying to open up the cabinet system in the county. Even non-cabinet Tories fed up and can't get information. Managed to get a motion passed to conduct a review, although was watered down somewhat. Noted that merging adult social care and health care is missing the point that quality has suffered due to cuts. For most part these are different systems so integration pointless. In any case, majority of people needing social care aren't eligible for it through the council. Have also added system for investigating and addressing elder abuse. Safeguarding children and children social care becoming a big, expensive problem. While built new children's homes to bring back people who had to be sent out of county. However, that hasn't happened because so many new children entering care—often because parents can't afford to feed them. Universal Credit will likely make this worse. Noted in case of closed Children Centres that cuts were made there because they are non-statutory and the money was needed for (statutory) children's social care. Austerity makes it very difficult to fund statutory requirements and everything else is cut to the bone. In responses to questions became clear how shortages of housing, fragmentation of schools, homelessness, crisis in social care are all related and feed into each other. The unitary authority proposal seems to have stalled. Annual conference report Full written report will be provided with the minutes. Cherry gave highlights (Lotte was stuck on a bus from Manchester). Was very positive about the experience, felt was in-tune with everyone for the first time. Notes how well-organised Women's Conference was and how good the speakers were. Reminded us that there was discussion of Brexit. She got the impression that, should talks breakdown and there be a Labour government then might see it reversed. For the most part this was a review of what she told us at the Momentum meeting. For example, she told the story of how the the compositing process tried to neuter the NHS motion. Felt that conference is too much to have just one delegate. In future we should consider sending more. This will be discussed at an executive meeting next week. Ann Black circulated a report giving a behind-the-scenes view. Notes there were way more CLP delegates than usual. Cherry was called out on not voting to debate the Brexit motions. She said while she wants it reversed (and thinks it will be) she didn't want to tie the PLP 's hands at this point—unlike things like the NHS where she does. Ann noted that there was a vote on the NEC statement of party policy on Brexit and a failed attempt to refer back part of the NPF International report. She also noted that the Brexit motions were varied and contradictory. Cherry added that there wasn't a clear vision to vote for on the Brexit motion. The chair said the executive will look to have an AMM discussing Brexit. Oxford city council report Co-deputy council leader spoke about a range of issues. Council chief executive given a 3 year contract, despite continued uncertainty over local government. Previously just had a 6 month contract. Westgate due to open on October 24th. Investment going ahead on East Oxford Community Centre. Zero-emissions zone mentioned (although John Tanner knows more), which will be a way to help bring down currently-illegal levels of air pollution. More information on council website. Spoke about Universal Credit and how disappointed that it will continue. Delays can cause major hardship in terms of paying rent, buying food, etc. Have concerns about the government's advanced payment system because there is such a quick clawback. City decided to set up a small fund to help people in dire need. This is needed because county council was the first in the country to get rid of their hardship fund. Trying to communicate with landlords to prevent evictions. Also engaging in a publicity campaign to help claimants understand the system. Other deputy leader (not an official post, just something Oxford is doing) also spoke. Noted that rules now require at least one women in the three leadership positions. Reported finances are stable and shouldn't be any major cuts in services in next few years. Council taxes will continue to increase at rate allowed without referendum. Continue benefits for low income people who can't afford tax. Capital funding still strong and engaging commercial development to help pay for services. Pay deal with unions will expire in a few years which leaves question mark. More risks have also been shifted onto local authorities. Have created own building company as way to get around limits for borrowing for council housing. Have been selling services for past few years to bring in money, but have been pushing up against legal limits set by central government. Setting up council-owned company to allow further expansion of this. Continuing to press central government on housing benefits. Council will not evict its own tenants and has been trying to prepare them for changes. Legal restrictions make it difficult to help homeless (especially if not citizens). Trying to build another hostel and have other housing options. Commitment to no cuts to homeless services (unlike county council, which has cut it almost entirely). Council threatening to strip Aung San Suu Kyi of freedom of city if doesn't step up around ethnic cleansing. Motion pointing out importance of single market access to city. Motion on improving cycling safety. Think I might have missed one because spoke very quickly. I asked about zero emission zone and what can be done in shorter term to improve air quality. Noted delivery lorries use those roads a lot and this will help. I'm pretty sure that requirement won't go into force until 2035. Waffled about how changes need to be phased in to allow people/companies to adjust. No time for me to respond. 1 BMW pension dispute Motion to prevent companies dismissing and rehiring workers to \"resolve\" a strike (referred to as \"termination and re-engagement\"). As we were running over and this is an important issue we will discuss it next month when there is more time. Will be a union speaker next month, so will fit in well with that. Parliamentary report Handed out copy of detailed report. Didn't speak very long so time for questions. Says her constituency role is getting harder. Lots of issues around immigration system, housing, and universal credit. Contact with Home Office has gotten even worse. Access to the hotline for Universal Credit only through MPs office, which places an extra hurdle and makes it harder for advocates. DWP no longer sharing info with council which will make it harder for council to offer support. Lots of calls to stop the role-out but government haven't listened so far. Opposition day debate will be on this and she hopes maybe they can get something done because situation is terrible. Also talked a bit about conference. She was on compositing committee for pay cap motion and was quite happy with how that went. Pleased with treasury announcements, particularly around credit card debt which she has worked on. Industry hasn't given much pushback. Positive about PFI announcement and notes that, even if expensive, not changing it is also expensive. Same applies to tuition fees where public purse id dealing with much lower payback rate than expected. Feels lots of common ground in LP over transitional period and limiting consolidation of government power. She's very concerned about government policy on customs, which she works on. She feels two proposals put forward are a mess and badly thought through (either similar to EU scheme, but not, or different custom scheme for goods destined for EU ). Government accruing more power over severance payment. Non-dom reform is inadequate and leaves lots of room to avoid tax. Labour is continuing to develop its own budget plans and draw up amendments for the upcoming budget. I asked for more details on McDonnell's \"war-gaming\". Backed him on planning for such thing. Her impression is that business thinks Labour seems more sane than Tories. Very concerned about complacency in government over various economic issues and we need to think about how to deal with this. Responded to various other questions. Noted in particular that we need transparency around Brexit. Lack of transparency breads distrust and doesn't help anyone. Shouldn't treat negotiations like a poker game but as something where we have a grown-up discussion. I spoke to John Tanner after the meeting. He confirmed that lorries will still be allowed in Cornmarket Street until 2035, although their times will be restricted. Other, short-term measures are being looked at for air pollution, such as shifting bus stops (although that requires county-council cooperation). I asked about whether George Street inclusion means busses to Gloucester Green will all have to be electric. He said they will, starting in 2025. This could just be hybrid-electric and using the electric motors while on George Street. ↩","tags":"Labour Party British Politics Meetings","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/oxford-district-labour-party-amm-october-2017.html","title":"Oxford & District Labour Party AMM October 2017"},{"text":"Timings for this meeting and minutes from last meeting passed without comment. There was one piece of urgent business, with a city councillor reminding us about the Oxford Living Wage Campaign and asking us all to show up to the launch. Parliamentary Report Anneliese thanks us for our help in the election and for continued campaigning. She mentioned that she thinks the Tories have dug in for awhile, so we'll have to stick with the campaigning. Also congratulated the council election result in Didcot. Brexit Felt government's position hasn't improved over summer and continues to alienate partners. Reminded us Labour's position is to have an interim agreement so that the UK won't fall off a cliff. In the meantime, Labour is pressing the Tories for details and votes in the house of commons. Not accepting the government rewriting labour/environmental laws without discussion. Criticised government for saying Electric Mini production in the UK is vote of confident in EU negotiations—it's a testament to the quality of the workforce. For long-term sustainability need a sensible trade relationship. Tax Issues Called out the government for continuing to tax redundancy payment while giving further concessions for non-doms. On the first there will be a vote but without any debate. Feels government is weak on this, with only 2 MPs willing to defend finance bill in the commons. Thinks Labour can push them on this. Housing Knows this is important to local activists. Post-Grenfall we were told would be an open debate on social housing, but it hasn't happened. The government still hasn't changed its views on regulations. Is afraid Tories will push ahead forcing housing associations to sell properties. Notes developers in Oxford salivating. Affordability is still defined too narrowly. Roll-out of Universal Credit is shambolic and could mean people will lose access to housing benefit. Questions Government trying to manipulate committees so they have a majority and also timing of committees. Seems to be an attempt to avoid scrutiny. When asked if anything we can do she only referred to work of MPs. Anneleise confirmed reduction in seats in parliament doesn't seem to be happening. This would have particularly hurt Labour. Not sure why government stepped away from this. (Ann heard DUP won't have it because would give Sinn Fein extra seats.) Will still be a boundary review. Will be some changes about parties registering which will make things more difficult for Labour. On questions of unity in PLP , she said she always seems to get on with everyone. Wasn't there when things were tense, so that might help. Says atmosphere remains good and hopes it will continue. In particular, hopes it will continue through Conference. If focus can stay on policies while Tories tear themselves apart then that will put Labour in a good position. Reiterated that doesn't see the government falling soon. Majorities typically around 14, which will be hard to break. Was asked about detailed policy work says trying to strike a balance between developing detailed policies and keeping focus on broad goals (i.e. keeping in election footing). Felt good progress being made in some parts of the party and reported that shadow Treasury team continues to engage with all relevant stakeholders. I asked how members can get more involved with policy, mentioning that NPF reports are vague and have no content. She didn't respond to my question, instead focusing on other questions asked in my tranche (see next paragraph). Expressed concern about international situation (refugees, etc.). Felt hasn't been sufficient response in Britain. Reports Labour has been doing some work on specific issues (such as persecution of Muslims in Burma). Highlighted insufficient support given to refugees. Wants to be sure it doesn't get lost in debate. Agreed with a member that it's important for party to stand up against hate crime. Called out Sarah Champion and worried it's distracting from real issues of child abuse, etc. Expressed worry about Islamophobia which has gotten worse since referendum. Is glad community in Oxford has tended to stand against any attempt to stir racism etc. up here. Expressed concern over academics making homophobic comments. Doesn't know what was said but feels if students were upset enough to complain then comments would have to be unacceptable. Equivocated a bit over vice-chancellor's high pay. Seemed to be saying she's concerned with this being used as a way to claim universities awash with money when aren't. Confirmed will continue her work around tax transparency and tackling tax avoidance. Will bring this up with finance bill next week. Wants to tighten rules for non-doms and to tackle money laundering, which Britain is becoming something of a centre for. Worker brought up BMW 's recent settlement of a pension dispute by essentially changing a contract. Asked if anything she could do to help from parliament, particularly if Labour forms government. She felt would be difficult to resolve situation under current legislation—will need to be changed. Could potentially become relevant in context of Brexit. Reminded us this will take a fight. Expressed concern about government position on immigration. Doesn't like how Tories have made this a big issue. Said Britain has low unemployment and needs immigrants to fill a wide range of jobs of varying levels of skills. Feels like immigration system for non- EU citizens isn't working for immigrants, businesses, public services, etc. Was asked about housing development with very expensive flats. As not in local government she could only make general comments. Said she understands it is difficult for local authorities to force developers to include affordable housing under current law. Hopes new infrastructure commission for Oxford-Cambridge corridor will allow new investment in housing, transport, public services in the area. Also see provided handout from Anneliese. Annual Conference Women's Confernce Arrangement Committee Delegates for Women's Conference not present. Branch delegates chose who they want our conference delegates to vote for on the committee. Chair expressed extreme displreasure that that women's delegates absent. Was some protest from the floor that there were extenuating circumstances. Resolutions Can send two resolutions (one from each constituency). First debate motions and vote on whether we support them. Then, if all three pass, choose which ones to prioritise. Ending UK support for Saudi Arabia John Tanner spoke on importance of ending attack on Yemen and increase pressure on Suadi's. Reminded us that motions must be contemporary and feels recent UN report means this one is. Resolution also refers to arms conversion to protect jobs in the UK arms industry. Unite has put out report on past proposals and successful conversions. No one spoke against, vote unanimous except for one abstention. A publicly owned banking system Calls for nationalising and democratically controlling large banks. Said was good thing that Labour bailed out banks, but wasn't enough control and bad how resulted in austerity. Points out bad behaviour of Loyd's and RBS while large stakes held by state. Similar motion being raised in Leeds. Feels this will continue developing manifesto. Contemporary because final shares in Loyd's just recent sold off. One person spoke against saying it's not a priority (costs lots of money). Also said looks like there might be another crash and better wipe-out private equity than public (plus would make cheaper if then want to nationalise). Felt connection between ownership and control insufficiently dealt with in motion. Another person spoke about it being an obvious policy. Someone else pointed out we'd be better off trying to stop another crash (via nationalisation) and that the public is on the hook anyway when private equity is lost. Ann Black thought incoming Labour government will have too much to do without running banking system. Politicians are not bankers. Not a priority. 28 for, 15 against, 26 abstentions by my count. Committee agreed it was carried but not by majority. NHS and Accountable Care System Liz said described how new Accountable Care System ( ACS ) bundles all health commissioners etc. in an area and takes it away from public scrutiny. These are equivalent to HMOs in United States and will make things ripe for privatisation. Also current move to sell off NHS properties which must be opposed. We need these properties to provide for increased care needs. Highlighted this is needed for next 20 years, not next 2. Motion based on one forwarded by Socialist Health Association. Seconder reminded of need for more money and for all Labour officials to oppose any cuts. One person felt there could be good debate for centralising certain services (based on medical issues rather than saving money) and worried this motion goes too far in blanket opposition. Another person said will abstain because arguments not based on studies of outcomes. Overwelmingly carried with only a few abstentions. Then we could each cast two votes for which resolutions to submit. I voted for bank nationalisation and the NHS motion. Was clear NHS and Suadi Arabia ones were far more popular—-only a few people voted for bank nationalisation. Someone spoke for continued membership of the Single Market. Hoped delegates would raise it at conference. Another speaker said she thinks Kier Starmer's stated position more realistic. National Constitutional Committee election This was up to branch delegates. Constitutional Amendments Lots to go through so Ann said we could just leave it to delegate's judgement. Ann's recommendations in her report were available. The floor thanked Ann for her work. One person wanted us to take a position on the McDonnell Amendment. May not come to a vote and instead be pushed towards other reforms. This was defeated by small margin. Ann a bit irritated that a lot of people voting to leave things to the delegates last time wanted all of the debated (hence prompting her to go to the effort of putting together a large document). Motion on Hate Crimes Increase in hate crimes over last year, especially towards Muslims. Women afraid to go out. Oxford East motion to bring back Commission of Racial Equality with authority to investigate hate crimes. Passed with overwhelming support and no extensions.

This, coupled with the even more surprising rise of Bernie Sanders in the United States, opens the question of whether something similar could happen in Canada. Cue Niki Ashton's candidacy in the ongoing federal leadership race of the New Democratic Party ( NDP ). As a Canadian living in Britain I've followed her campaign with great interest to see how it stacks up against the Corbyn project. One area where I have been distinctly disappointed in Corbyn has been on energy and climate policy . Rather than argue for a rationally planned, publicly owned electricity system, he has pandered to the current \"progressive\" fad of an energy market made up of many small, competing renewable energy generators. Instead of replacing the private energy suppliers, he has opted to merely to add a public supplier to the market. While nuclear energy is not rejected, it is clearly seen as secondary to renewable energy and will also remain in the private sector. I have argued in the past why renewable energy will not be sufficient to power Britain and why a competitive energy market is an obstacle to addressing climate change. Meanwhile, very little concrete is said by Labour about tackling climate change. There is a commitment to have 65% clean energy by 2030, which is either an ambitious goal they have not developed policy to meet or an extremely unambitious one stemming from a confusion of \"energy\" and \"electricity\". In the election manifesto there is some vague talk of home insulation and electrifying the railways (although the latter was not discussed in an environmental context), but otherwise nonelectric energy use is unaddressed. A supplementary document mentions other technologies such as heat pumps, district heating, carbon capture and storage, and electric vehicles but says little about the type or scale of investments to be made in them, or how they come together in a broader climate plan. Indeed, the need for a comprehensive climate plan seems to be ignored, with a piecemeal approach of disconnected commitments offered instead. In stark contrast to Corbyn, Ashton has made fighting climate change a central feature of her campaign, rather than just one area to which to direct stimulus funding. While not perfect, there is a lot about her proposals which are very good. First and foremost, rather than talk about tackling climate change in terms of sacrifices people will have to make (as do many environmentalists), she does so by laying out a positive vision of the country we want to live in. She describes how her policies will bring better employment, housing, and communities. She even extends this to workers in polluting industries, sketching a framework which would see them usefully redeployed. This is the sort of approach which will motivate people to take action. Unlike many liberal environmentalists, such as those in the Green Party of Canada and its provincial affiliates, Ashton recognises the role which the public sector must play in fighting climate change; collective solutions are favoured over individual actions. Rather than the usual emphasis on feed-in-tariffs and independent electricity producers, she stresses that new energy infrastructure will be public. Like Corbyn she calls for a public investment bank to fund projects, but she goes further and proposes an additional crown corporation 1 called Green Canada 2 . This entity would not only assist in basic research in green technology, but commercialise and manufacture it. It would Accelerate pollution-fighting technology by funding open-source research into solutions for the climate change challenges we face and invest in public sector clean energy innovation. Every scenario for avoiding runaway climate change includes a technological breakthrough we don't have yet. The public sector has an important role to play in fostering innovation. Green Canada will partner with our public universities to fund and carry out basic and applied research in renewable energy and energy efficiency at dedicated new research institutes. The rewards of research breakthroughs will be shared by all of us: selected successful research will be the basis for new manufacturing projects run directly by Green Canada. In time, this crown corporation will grow into a complex green technology actor, reinvesting funds into research, taking on strategic production tasks that aid in meeting climate goals and providing the federal government with streams of revenues for other needs. This exactly the sort of approach needed for decarbonisation. Just as importantly, it reintroduces the idea of public ownership not simply to run what is unprofitable, but for the purpose of economic development and innovation. This pledge is honestly one of the most exciting proposals I have seen from a politician in my lifetime. The other exciting aspect of Ashton's proposals are the Green Canada Advisory Boards. Four such boards would be created, working in forestry, agriculture, fishing, and energy and made up of representatives of workers, environmental experts, different levels of government, industry, and indigenous people. Together they would direct the operations of Green Canada and set best practices. One advantage of such a system is that it would give workers in polluting industries a say over how they are to be reformed or wound down. This would make it easier to achieve buy-in for potentially controversial reforms. More broadly, this would begin to provide democratic control over public industry, something which has been missing from crown corporations in the past. While Corbyn has paid lip-service to this goal, Ashton has done more to spell out what it could look like. Ashton's pledges are a bit weaker when it comes to non-electric forms of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions. Indeed, she currently lacks a clear schedule for reductions, although a promise is made to convene a group of experts for this purpose. Presumably the Green Canada Advisory Boards for agriculture and forestry would be responsible for addressing GHG emissions from their respective sectors and from land use change. Home heating is explicitly mentioned as an issue which needs to be addressed, but more details could be provided. It would also be good if district heating schemes were developed, given that they fit well with Ashton's emphasis on collective ownership. Electric vehicles are mentioned with a laudable emphasis on building charging infrastructure, particularly on federal property such as post offices. Unfortunately, no commitment is made to electrify the government fleet of vehicles—creating a large initial market for them—although this may have been an oversight. Electrifying local public transit is another important issue which she addresses. However, her goal of phasing out the sale of internal combustion engines by 2040 is not ambitious enough. She also does not address transport over longer distances, particularly of freight. We need to electrify Canada's railways and move goods off of roads and onto trains. Ideally this would be achieved by nationalising the rail companies and folding them into the public passenger operator, Via Rail. My final concern is that Ashton seems intent on powering Canada using only renewable energy. If this can even be done 3 , it will almost certainly require a significant build-out of new hydro dams. These are often controversial, given that they flood large areas of land, and can lead to conflicts with local aboriginal groups. Given Ashton's (laudable) championing of aboriginal issues and the Left's opposition to the Site C hydro damn in British Columbia, I'm not sure the will would exist to pursue this. Hydro is also distributed very unevenly across the country, meaning some provinces would become extremely reliant on others for their electricity. I rather doubt this would be well received, especially for those which would come to depend on Quebec. Ideally, a renewable plan would see the creation of a single national power company out of existing provincial ones, to utilise hydro nation-wide. However, constitutionally this would require all provinces to agree and I can't see hydro-rich ones (particularly Quebec) doing so. Indeed, such jurisdictional issues will make it more difficult for the federal government to pursue any green energy policy and Ashton does not address this. For provinces without much hydro and which want a degree of self-sufficiency in electricity, the options are carbon capture and storage or nuclear. Neither of these are mentioned in Ashton's proposals, although I was very pleased to see that they are not explicitly ruled out either. My preference would be for nuclear, as nuclear waste will likely be easier and cheaper to store than carbon dioxide. Canada also has existing expertise in nuclear energy on which to build, with over half of Ontario's electricity coming from this source. To this end, I would like to see Ashton commit to renationalise CANDU Energy 4 and fold it into Green Canada. These criticisms aside, Ashton has laid out a very good initial blueprint for fighting climate change. While more detail is needed on some issues, this is only a policy proposal for party leadership and it can be expected to undergo further development before a general election. Despite this, in some areas it is already better developed than the policies which the Labour Party ran on. Furthermore, unlike Corbyn's proposals, there are no fundamental problems with what Ashton has put forward; any changes which I want to see made only involve tweaking or expanding upon the framework already developed. I sincerely hope that these proposals will gain broad attention within Canada and beyond. In particular, socialists and environmentalists in the UK would do well to take notice. \" Crown corporation\" (or \"crown corp\") is the Canadian term for a state enterprise. ↩ Which, despite fitting the usual naming scheme for federal bodies, I must say is a horrible awkward name. ↩ Unlike Britain, Canada has enough land that we can definitely capture enough renewable energy to meet our needs. The problem is that it remains unclear if any country can provide a continuous, reliable electricity supply using only renewable sources without massive hydro and geothermal capacity. ↩ The division of engineering firm SNC Lavalin formed when they bought the reactor-design portion of crown corporation Atomic Energy Canad Limited. ↩","tags":"Energy Climate Change British Politics Canadian Politics Labour Party NDP","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/on-climate-change-ashton-beats-corbyn.html","title":"On Climate Change, Ashton Beats Corbyn"},{"text":"In response to the recent publication by the Labour Party's National Policy Forum ( NPF ) of various policy statements, a number of us on the Labour Left have written responses. My response on environmental, energy, and transport policy was published on Left Futures . This is the longer, original version. I have have also produced another version of this report which is more suited for use amending or replacing parts of the NPF 's document, taking into account comments received on my article. Thanks you to David Pavett for his comments and suggestions. The National Policy Forum has made the strange decision to group culture with the environment and energy . Meanwhile, transport is placed, not completely without justification, with local government and housing. However, as transport is a major consumer of energy and a transport policy will be essential to fighting climate change, I decided to address it along with energy and the environment, in place of culture. Climate Change The NPF document rightly identifies climate change as one of the greatest challenges of the century. However, beyond this, it has little to say. It refers to the Paris Agreement of 2015, but does not acknowledge that the stated goal of keeping warming below 2°C, or even 1.5°C, is not going to be achieved with the emissions commitment which were made. Nor is the magnitude of the challenge of keeping temperatures below those limits recognised. It seems inconceivable that it could be done without state-directed economic planning on a scale previously unseen in the West during peacetime. Figure 1: United Kingdom greenhouse gas emissions, 1990-1995. (Department of Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy, 7 February 2017) The NPF believes that \"Labour has a strong record in pressing for and tackling climate change.\" While it is true, as they say, that Labour passed the Climate Change Act in 2008, this was also supported by all but three of the Tories. The actual reductions in emissions during Labour's time in government were not much different from what occurred under John Major and the Coalition (see Figure 1 ) and did not come close to what is necessary. A recently published climate plan required global emissions to fall by half every decade until at least 2050 and a developed country like Britain will be required to making even faster cuts than that. If it is felt that this is unachievable, then we need to be upfront about that and begin preparing for the negative impacts of climate change. Three omissions by this policy document should be noted. The first is its failure to mention high-potency greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. When weighted for global warming potential, these make up nearly 20% of UK emissions, with methane being the most significant. Typically, emissions of these gases are easier to prevent than those of carbon dioxide, so rapid action should be taken to reduce them. Secondly, no reference is made to the use of \" negative emissions \" technology, which most plans for combating climate change now require. This involves planting trees, burning them, and sequestering the released carbon underground. Finally, the effect of land use changes (e.g. deforestation, conversion to agriculture) is not mentioned, although at least one climate plan requires net emissions from this to reach zero by 2050. Overall, it appears that the authors of this document know little about climate change and have vastly underestimated the magnitude of the challenge it now represents. The closest the NPF comes to suggesting actual policy is to commit that \"By investing £500 billion in infrastructure backed up by a publicly owned National Investment Bank and regional banks we will build a high-skilled, high tech, low carbon economy to help generate a million good quality jobs.\" Lacking any details of what sorts of investments are involved, this pledge is useless. Where specific sectors, such as energy, are mentioned, no solutions are proposed. In the following sections, some priority sectors will be examined in closer detail. In the following sections, some priority sectors will be examined in closer detail and some broad policies put forward. Energy More than once, the NPF comments on the importance of decarbonising energy while at the same time tackling energy bills. The obvious tension between wanting to \"curb energy bill rises\" while at the same time invest in new energy infrastructure is never acknowledged. While it is said that the \"energy market is in need of reform\", what this reform would look like is never stated. Indeed, the very existence of a market in energy is never questioned; despite widespread support for renationalisation, the most the NPF has to say on this issue is calling for a \"National Investment Bank to promote public investment and community ownership across future energy solutions\". Although acknowledging that \"A fully costed low carbon energy platform that includes renewables, nuclear and green gas should be developed and publicly financed options should be considered to ensure that the UK has a low carbon economy that works for consumers moving forwards\", no effort has been taken to do this. As I have argued elsewhere , any realistic decarbonisation plan will need to rely heavily on nuclear energy. Although this would be an unpopular proposition among many on the left, we need to face up to the impossibility of powering Britain solely off of her own renewables. Nuclear power can be most effectively deployed by the state using a standardised design, adding another argument for nationalisation. A similar argument could be made about renewable power sources. As I have argued in the past , a new Power Generation Board ( PGB ) should be created out of existing nuclear and renewable capacity and be given control over the national grid. This would go some way to ending the absurdity which is the market in electricity and would give the stability needed for the PGB to make long-term investments To eliminate fuel poverty, progressive tariffs could be used. This would see every household given a minimum amount of electricity at low or zero-cost, with the price per additional kilowatt-hour rising to current levels and above depending on how much is used in a given month. The price bands could be structured such that high-use customers are effectively paying for the electricity of low-use customers and this system would not be a cost to the government. However, for this to work, all consumers would need to be buying from the same electricity supplier. As such, supply and distribution should also be nationalised and either folded in the PGB or passed to a devolved body. Little is said in the NPF document about non-electric energy use. As electricity only represents 29% of greenhouse-gas emissions , this is a glaring omission. \"Green gas\" is mentioned and this could be introduced into the gas supply as a short-term measure to reduce emissions from heating. Some hydrogen could also be added and, if appliances are converted, the gas supply could be switched entirely to hydrogen. However for new houses (and, in the mid-term, for existing ones), better energy efficiency can achieved using electric heat pumps. Transport will also need to be electrified and this will be discussed in more detail below. Finally, nothing is said in the document about energy efficiency. All new homes should be built to the highest standards of insulation and, to the extent feasible, old homes should be retrofitted along these lines. New home designs should try to maximise daylight and heat from the sun. Even in the NPF document on housing, such things are not considered. Appliances should be subject to strict efficiency requirements and the government could create a program to buy old, inefficient models back from citizens. Agriculture Agriculture is included in environmental policy, although the main focus of the NPF draft seems to be on the issue of subsidies post-Brexit. I will leave this issue to someone who knows more about agricultural economics. However, it might be worth considering whether a system of supply management could replace subsidies. This would involve farmers selling to marketing boards which they run in partnership with the state. The marketing boards then operate a monopoly on wholesale and return any profits to the farmers. For the overall system to be effective, controls would be required on imports and exports of the managed agricultural products, which may not be possible depending on the UK 's relationship with the EU . Agriculture is also a major source of greenhouse gases, making up 10% of the UK 's total . These are mostly in the form of methane and nitrous oxide. The former is produced in the digestive systems of livestock (particularly cattle) while the latter comes from the use of fertilisers. While this is not an area which I am greatly knowledgeable about, measures such as more precise application of fertiliser , better soil management, different crop rotations, new animal feeds, supplements to animal feeds, and breading could all play a role. Any agricultural subsidies should be made conditional on farmers taking action to reduce their emissions. Transport The only policies which can be found within the NPF report on transport are to take \"the railways back into public ownership\" and \"give local authorities franchising powers to run and manage their local bus routes\". While the inadequacy and expense of public transport are acknowledged, there are no concrete proposals to tackle either. Rail While the commitment to bring rail franchises back into public ownership is laudable, there are many other questions to be answered about rail. First, what is to happen to the Rolling Stock Companies (ROSCOs) which lease the trains to the franchise operators? These are obscenely profitable , take essentially no risk, and have failed to adequately invest in new rolling stock. While nationalising franchises would cost essentially nothing, the ROSCOs would be quite expensive. One approach would be for the government to regulate them and trim the profit margins. Where new rolling stock is introduced, it should be publicly owned. As decarbonisation demands a campaign of rail electrification, plenty of new stock will be required. It would be worth considering recreating British Rail Engineering Limited to build this in-house. Network Rail present another question. Currently it provides a hidden subsidy to the train operators by charging artificially low track access fees . The difference is made up by a government grant and borrowing. With each infrastructure upgrade, its debt continues to ballootheytheytheyn. While not sustainable, this has led to increased investment compared to the days of British Rail, when funding was at the whim of whoever was in government. A new model is clearly needed, but what it should be is unclear. Furthermore, the question of exactly what new investments are needed in rail (e.g. electrification) needs to be addressed. A final consideration for rail is how a newly nationalised sector should be structured. It has been suggested that the railways should be more decentralised than they were under British Rail. Allowing large local authorities to manage commuter rail, in the model of London Overground, does seem reasonable. However, devolving regional rail services risks continuing the fragmentation which has marked the sector since privatisation. Perhaps a compromise would be to have trains operated by a single national company but allow local and regional governments to be represented in the administration of regional routes. Buses It is welcome that the buses are acknowledged by the NPF and giving local authorities more control over service is undoubtedly a good idea. However, it is unclear what exactly is meant by \"franchising powers to run and manage their local bus routes\". Presumably it refers to a system such as that in London where, even if a private company operates the buses, they do so under contract with a local authority, which sets and collects fares, determines routes, etc. Private operators will fight attempts by local authorities to do this, so the process should be tilted in favour of the councils. Additionally, funding should be provided by central government to help buy or create council-owned bus companies. There should also be an emphasis of integrating buses and local transport with the rail system. Regional and national buses were not mentioned by the report. These should also be re-regulated and, preferably, taken back into public ownership. There may be a role for devolved administrations to play in the management of these services. New buses should be electric, either being trolley-buses or battery powered. Other Public Transport No reference at all is made to other forms of transport. It is worth considering whether current ferry services are adequate and whether these should be brought back into the public sector. Ferry service could be integrated with rail so as to provide a seamless alternative to flying. Rationalising air routes would also go some way to reducing emissions from aviation, suggesting that renationalisation of airports and re-regulation of airlines should be on the table. It would be worth considering whether a rail tunnel could be built to Ireland to replace many flights. A running theme through all of this has been the need to integrate transport across jurisdictions and modes. This would make public transit a more viable alternative to driving and flying. There is a strong argument for making local transport free at the point of use, to make it more accessible to those on low incomes and to encourage use by everyone. Regional and national travel would still require fares, but a single, simple ticketing system should be adopted across the entire country for buses, trains, and ferries, allowing trips to be planned and purchased in a single place. Private Vehicles Private transport goes completely unmentioned by the NPF . While an affordable and comprehensive mass transit system will go some way to reducing the use of private automobiles, it obviously can not eliminate it. A date should be set beyond which all cars sold in Britain must be zero-emissions vehicles. For this to be practical, an expansion in charging infrastructure is needed for electric cars. Fast charging stations could be placed at existing petrol stations, while (cheaper) slower ones could be placed in car-parks. A public electrical company would be ideally placed to operate these. Widespread adoption of electric vehicles would also be useful in levelling out peaks in electricity demand, as owners could program them to charge when demand is low (e.g. overnight) and, if necessary, feed some of their energy back into the grid when demand is high. Conclusion Climate change is perhaps the greatest threat humanity has ever faced, and mitigating it will be a task similar in scale to the conversion to a wartime economy. The NPF displays no awareness of this fact and has made no effort to draw up the detailed plans which will be required. Instead they have contented themselves with vague, feel-good slogans while ignoring crucial areas of climate policy. If Britain and the rest of the world continue to take such an approach, then climate change will be a catastrophe and perhaps even an existential threat to future generations.","tags":"Energy British Politics Climate Change Transport Labour Party","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/labour-policy-responses-environment-energy-and-transport.html","title":"Labour Policy Responses: Environment, Energy and Transport"},{"text":"I have written a series of four articles discussing Britain's energy policy for the left-wing Labour-supporting website Left Futures . In Part 1 I explain the limits of renewable energy sources. Part 2 advocates for the role of nuclear power in an energy transition. Various technologies which should be used and policies which should be enacted in order to improve energy efficiency and electrify heat and transport are discussed in Part 3 . Finally, Part 4 proposes an ownership framework capable of building the electricity infrastructure needed. As discussed in Part 3, the transition to a low-carbon economy is a massive task which will require extensive government intervention. During the most recent leadership campaign, Jeremy Corbyn promised to \"promote the growth of over 200 ‘local energy companies'\" and to \"support the development of 1,000 community energy co-operatives\". Although the exact meaning is unclear, presumably by \"local energy companies\" he is referring to council-owned gas and electricity distributors such as Nottingham's Robin Hood Energy . The \"community energy co-operatives\" would appear to refer the small generators of renewable electricity which can be found across Britain. The Brighton Energy Co-operative presents an example. While placing electricity distribution in the hands of local authorities may well be a good idea, it is important to consider what Corbyn's proposal actually involves. It is in no way, shape, or form nationalisation of any part of the electricity industry. In Nottingham, the physical infrastructure is owned by Western Power Distribution , a subsidiary of the American energy company PPL Corporation. Nor do all Nottingham residents purchase their electricity from the council; Robin Hood Energy is simply one option along with the Big Six and other, smaller, competitors. In fact, the way the energy market is currently regulated means that Robin Hood Energy must offer to sell electricity and gas to people all across Britain. Should such municipal companies become wide-spread across the UK , one would expect them to make inroads against the Big Six, but remain only one set of players in the market. This would not address the problems of money wasted on advertising, promotions, and the bureaucracy needed to manage people changing suppliers. On the other hand, there is almost nothing positive to be said about energy co-operatives. In most sectors, a co-operative is owned by its employees or its customers, but for energy this is not the case. Instead, locals become members of the co-operative by paying to finance new energy projects . Given the way the energy market is structured in the UK , it is impossible for them to then buy their power from the co-op. Instead, the co-op sells its power to one of the energy supply companies and returns the profits to its investors as dividends. These are generous dividends at that: Brighton Energy Co-operative aims to make a 5% return on investment each year , which is substantially higher than the cost of servicing public-sector borrowing . Despite all their talk of \"community ownership\", energy co-ops would appear to have far more in common with Margaret Thatcher's \"share-owning democracy\" than with a socialist vision of society and are a far-cry from Corbyn's calls, early in his first leadership campaign, to nationalise the energy companies. Historical Energy Ownership While the exact structure of the nationalised British electrical sector changed somewhat under different post-war governments, it was broadly as follows. The Central Electricity Generating Board ( CEGB ) owned all power plants and the national grid. The distribution infrastructure (wires leading into people's homes) was owned by 14 area electricity boards. The CEGB was responsible for ensuring that there was always sufficient electricity supply for the country, which was bought by the area electricity boards and then sold on to customers. Scotland had a somewhat different structure to this, which is beyond the scope of this article. Upon privatisation, the CEGB was split up into the national grid and three generating companies. These were sold off over a few years, along with the area electricity boards. Today, there are four components to the sector. National Grid plc owns the high-voltage transmission lines and is the \"system operator\" (turning power plants on and off to match supply and demand). Similarly, in each region there will be a single company owning and maintaining the distribution network . Generation consists of various companies, ranging from giants like EDF to small renewable energy co-ops . Finally, there are the supply companies that we all actually purchase our electricity from. The supply companies purchase electricity on a wholesale market from various generating companies. Initially upon nationalisation, gas was the responsibility of 12 area gas boards , with a central Gas Council acting a a coordinator and liaison with the government. In the 1970s these boards were merged in to the single British Gas Corporation . Prior to privatisation, the Thatcher government required British Gas to carry natural gas for other suppliers. Unlike electricity, gas was privatised as a single unit, becoming British Gas plc . A series of restructurings and demergers followed, with the gas mains now owned by National Grid plc . Exploration, production, storage, and sale of gas is now performed by various companies. The Ownership Structures of Tomorrow So much for the past; what of the future? The three over-riding requirements for a 21 st century electricity sector are to produce energy cleanly, reliably, and as cheaply as possible. A Labour government must act to ensure rapid decarbonisation of the electricity supply, while at the same time increasing electricity production and ensuring that the lights remain on. As all low-carbon sources of electricity are capital-intensive and have slow return on investment, the only way to make the private sector build it is to provide generous fixed prices for the electricity. This is expensive, so it makes far more sense to build these projects in the public sector, especially given the low interest rates at which a government can borrow. Thus, public ownership is a practical policy in this situation. A newly-created Power Generation Board ( PGB ) would be given a strict and aggressive time-table to build new infrastructure with which to decarbonise Britain's electricity supply and begin replacing non-electric energy sources. The exact details of how this would be achieved are a technical matter best addressed by experts. However, for reasons discussed in earlier sections, it seem clear that nuclear power will have to play a major part in any sustainable energy mix. Nuclear power is cheapest when built by a public sector with capacities for economic planning and direction, as was the case for France in the 1970s. Currently Britain lacks such capacities. To begin to regain them, measures should be taken to concentrate nuclear expertise in the state. One important step in this direction would be nationalising the existing nuclear power plants, to be placed in the hands of the PGB . Furthermore, an additional state enterprise, in the vein of the old British Nuclear Fuels Limited ( BNFL ), should be created and tasked with developing new reactor designs, advising the PGB , decommissioning old reactors, proposing new fuel cycles, examining issues around waste, etc. Initially, it would be formed out of the existing Nuclear Decommissioning Authority , with all outsourced operations brought back in-house, and the National Nuclear Laboratory . The Office for Nuclear Regulation (\"Ofnuke\") would remain strictly independent from both this enterprise and the PGB . Britain should support international cooperation and research in the nuclear sector and, contrary to current Conservative plans, remain a member of Euratom . Given that the cost of government borrowing is lower than the returns expected by private (even co-operative) electricity producers, it would also make sense to nationalise the existing renewable infrastructure. As in the case of nationalising nuclear reactors, this has the further advantaging of bringing expertise into the public sector. On the other hand, given that fossil fuel assets are to be phased out as rapidly as possible, it would likely be better to leave most of these in the private sector and avoid the public having to pay decommissioning costs. The PGB would act as a single purchaser (monopsony) for all privately-produced electricity, which would provide an effective form of public control over this sector. In order to ensure that pressure to cut electricity costs does not lead to poorer pay or working conditions in the private companies, sectoral collective bargaining should be used. In the event that the PGB deems the cost of purchasing electricity privately is greater than the cost of nationalising the producer, the producer should be taken into public ownership. Such an arrangement would require a radical change to current regulations. At a minimum, distribution companies must be prohibited from purchasing electricity from anyone other than the PGB , in order to ensure that low-carbon electricity is being used. Given this, the PGB should take over the role of the transmission system operator from National Grid plc. Ideally, the transmission infrastructure itself would also be nationalised, although this is not strictly necessary for the energy transition described here. A monopoly in generation also means there is little point in having competing distribution companies selling electricity to customers or in separating them from the distribution networks. In the event of devolution to the English regions, a tidy approach would be to require each of them (along with Scotland and Wales) to maintain an electricity board to operate the distribution infrastructure and be the monopoly supplier of power to consumers. It would also be possible to have local authorities play this roll. In either case, it should be illegal for them to reprivatise these assets. Alternatively, the PGB could perform this role too, forming a fully vertically-integrated utility. While this might achieve greater economy of scale and such a move was recommended in the 1970s , it does somewhat cut against the present zeitgeist for localism. Nationalisation Costs There would be a cost of nationalising the electricity transmission and distribution networks. This might lead some to argue that a Labour government should hold off on such actions. However, it makes more sense to structure the PGB and any newly-created public distributors to be able to operate these assets from the start rather than have to reorganise them later. Additionally, the cost of servicing any debt incurred would almost certainly be less than the cost of paying to use these networks. While it has been claimed that nationalising the energy sector would cost an eye-watering £185 billion , this number is flawed as it assumes compensation would be paid at full-market rates and that overseas assets would also be purchased. Another report argued that compensation could be provided only at the value of a company's equity, making nationalising Britain's electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure cost £8.4 billion 1 . Nationalising all of the Big 6 would cost £44.4 billion. However, there is no need to expropriate their supply businesses—these would simply become obsolete with the introduction of publicly-owned ones. As stated above, fossil fuel power plants would be left in the private sector—at least initially. Given that all of these companies have diverse energy portfolios, the cost of nationalising just nuclear and renewable generation can only be estimated. The Big 6 make up about 70% of the UK generation market. If all of their equity is in this portion of of their business, then the equity-value of the entire generation sector is about £63.4 billion. Nuclear and renewable sources supply about 45% of Britain's electricity, so the cost of nationalising this infrastructure should be about £30 billion. It must be stressed that this is an extremely pessimistic number, as it assumes all equity is tied up in generation infrastructure. As gas should be phased out and replaced with electricity, there is little point in nationalising this side of the energy industry. Should some other use be found for parts of the gas network (e.g. transporting hydrogen or providing district heating) then the relevant portions of it should be brought into public ownership. The supply-side of this industry could either be regulated or this role could be performed in the public sector, e.g. by councils or the PGB . European Energy Directives The above represents an idealised scenario for energy ownership. However, it is in radical violation of current EU energy policy . This policy requires an open market, unbundling of electricity distribution from generation, and regulators independent from government. During Brexit negotiations, Britain should strive to avoid being bound by these directives. Should this prove unsuccessful, then there are two options: knowingly disobeying the directives or adapting the above strategy to lie within them. Could this plan be sufficiently adapted? The following components would not be possible: integrating the system operator into the PGB , requiring all electricity to be purchased from the PGB , permitting private generators only to sell to the PGB , and creating a public monopoly in supply. It would still be possible to have the system operator in the public sector and to direct it to prefer clean energy sources over fossil fuels, so long as it in no way favoured the PGB . It would also be possible to require a certain portion of electricity purchased by private suppliers to be clean. Should an electricity wholesale market remain in any form, it will likely make investment in new energy sources more difficult. All low-carbon electricity has high capital costs but low operating costs. This means that investment only makes sense if future electricity prices are known. When electricity is produced by a single vertically-integrated supplier this is the default position, but not so in a market where the wholesale price fluctuates on an hourly basis. The existence of multiple suppliers is also problematic, as it would prevent more direct means of controlling price and tariff structures. Inefficiencies associated with having multiple suppliers, such as marketing and promotional deals, would persist. If Britain chooses to stick to the EU energy regulations, then we will have to content ourselves with much less direct means of influencing the energy system and the possibility that companies will be able to exploit loopholes or sabotage government plans. Most concerning of all, European officials have indicated that state-backed investment and regulated prices (as done during France's past build-out of nuclear reactors) would violate state-aid rules. As that is the model set forth here for Britain, this is very worrying. This must be the ultimate red-line. Without this form of state-aid, decarbonisation is all but impossible. Whatever is decided with regards to the existence of an electricity market, the UK must be willing to violate EU rules on state aid. Conclusion Energy policy is a highly technical matter involving politics, economics, engineering, fundamental physics, and law. Books can, and have, been written on these matters, so this series of articles can only provide an overview of the issues. As has been seen, transition to a low carbon economy will not be easy and will not be possible using only (or even mainly) renewable energy. Nuclear power must play a role. The sort of transition described here will require not only active state intervention in the energy sector, but in many other parts of the economy as well. A Labour government intent on protecting the environment must be prepared for the magnitude of the task and be willing to violate EU directives in order to achieve it. To paraphrase a cliché, the choice before us is clear: socialism or environmental disaster. The lower value of £7.5 billion quoted in the report seemed to assume that money would be paid to the government when nationalising those distribution companies with negative equity. This seems unlikely—the best we could hope for in those cases is not to have to pay any compensation. ↩","tags":"Energy British Politics Nationalisation Electricity Nuclear Power","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/a-21st-century-energy-policy-part-4-the-institutions-to-make-it-happen.html","title":"A 21 st Century Energy Policy, Part 4: The Institutions to Make it Happen"},{"text":"I have written a series of four articles discussing Britain's energy policy for the left-wing Labour-supporting website Left Futures . In Part 1 I explain the limits of renewable energy sources. Part 2 advocates for the role of nuclear power in an energy transition. Various technologies which should be used and policies which should be enacted in order to improve energy efficiency and electrify heat and transport are discussed in Part 3 . Finally, Part 4 proposes an ownership framework capable of building the electricity infrastructure needed. If humanity is to have any hope of avoiding catastrophic climate change, developed countries must take aggressive steps to decarbonise as quickly as possible. This will mean not only replacing existing fossil-fuel power plants, but greatly expanding all electricity production to replace gas and petrol. Such a task demands not just an energy policy, but a comprehensive economic plan . For reasons discussed in Part 1, decarbonisation is not achievable using only renewable sources. Investments should certainly be made in wind, and (where feasible) hydroelectric, tidal, and geothermal power, but even combined these are unlikely to provide more than half of the current supply. The remainder must be made up by nuclear power. This is broadly in line with what energy analyst David MacKay proposed as \" Plan E \" in his book Sustainable Energy—Without the Hot Air . This was the plan which he deemed to be the most economical of those he proposed. Sustainable Energy—Without the Hot Air , by David MacKay, offers an extremely detailed examination of how energy is used, how it can be conserved, and how it can be produced. To improve cost effectiveness, new nuclear reactors should be built to a standard design, perhaps initially an established one with known costs; the spiralling costs at Hinkley C (which should probably be cancelled ) show what can happen when a new and untested design is used. Such a strategy is similar to the mass build-out of nuclear reactors in France during the 1970s and 80s. Unfortunately, Britain today lacks the capacity for state-directed economic development which France had at that time. Steps to regain it will be discussed in Part 4. According to statistics provided by the Department of Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy , currently electricity makes up about 20% of Britain's energy usage, while gas accounts for about 30% and petroleum products for almost all of the rest. Gas and petrol will need to be phased out, as they can not be decarbonised. When faced with these numbers, the scale of the task ahead becomes apparent; not only must the majority of the existing electricity supply be replaced, but it must be expanded several times over. Fortunately, there is much which can be done to improve efficiency, somewhat reducing the amount of new capacity needed. Measures such as insulation could realistically result in a reduction of 15% in energy used for heating existing buildings by 2030. Obviously, new buildings should be required to meet high efficiency standards. Old and inefficient boilers could be replaced, although the phasing out of gas might mean that this is not worthwhile. The question then emerges as to how to achieve the upgrading of old buildings. The Green Party has, in the past, proposed that households should simply be given the insulation for free. However, this amounts to little more than a gift to those well-off enough to own their house or a gift to landlords. The government could offer to finance insulation at a rate where the cost would be covered by savings in gas bills. However, landlords would have to be permitted to increase rents accordingly for this to provide them with an incentive. Further discussion will be needed on this issue. Various options exist to replace gas for heat and hot water. The simplest would be electric baseboard heating and immersion heating, which are a well-established technologies with cheap up-front costs. The upfront costs for these are relatively cheap, although still significant. In parts of Canada most people rent their water heaters from the power company and a similar option could be pursued here. Note, however, that with the UK 's present electricity supply, this form is heating is actually worse for the environment than gas, so it should only be rolled out after substantial electricity decarbonisation. Heat pumps offer a few times better energy efficiency than conventional electric heating but have very high up-front costs. Mass producing heat pumps, in order to bring down the price, should be one aim of national industrial policy and the government should also offer to finance their installation or allow customers to rent them from the power company. Solar thermal panels can be coupled with these systems to help provide hot water. In areas with sufficiently high population density, district heating should likely play a substantial role. Where practical, this should use waste heat from power plants. This was done in Westminster with the old Battersea Power Station. A publicly owned electricity company should build such systems around any nuclear or geothermal power plants, possibly in partnership with local authorities. Heat can also be extracted from large bodies of water , sewage , and the ground using heat pumps. The government should offer loans to councils which wish to invest in such projects. Binding efficiency requirements must be set for consumer and industrial goods and these should be regularly updated. A government program to purchase older white-goods, similar to Obama's \" cash for clunkers \" program, could be used to incentivise upgrading to more energy-efficient models. A similar approach could be taken with other goods such a televisions and light-bulbs. Gas ovens and hobs will eventually become obsolete and need to be replaced. A concerted effort should be made to shift people out of cars and onto public transit. One step in this direction would be free public transit . Congestion charges, pedestrian zones, road tolls, and reduced speed limits can all be used to discourage car use. Cycling routes and infrastructure should be improved. 100% electrification should be a goal for railways and some of the routes closed under the Beeching Axe of the 1960s should be considered for reopening. The current bus fleet should be gradually replaced by trolleys, trolley-buses, and battery-powered buses. This will be more difficult for long-distance buses, as batteries have limited range and it may be impractical to run wires over the long stretches of highway. To the extent that private vehicles continue to be used, they will have to be electric and government action will be needed to develop the charging infrastructure. Long-distance freight should increasingly be transported by rail and local freight by electric trucks. Long distance travel by air or sea is more difficult as there are no nearby electrical wires to power it. The energy density of batteries is only a few percent of diesel or jet fuel , making it impossible to fit enough of them on a ship or plane to power a voyage. Alternatives such as biofuels or hydrogen are still decades away and, in the case of the former, there are concerns about them displacing essential food production. In the meantime, rail should start to replace short-haul aviation, particularly for domestic flights. Various incremental improvements can be made to reduce energy use by planes. Research into alternatives to jet fuel should be continued and expanded. Shipping remains quite energy efficient and thus is not an initial priority for decarbonisation but, in addition to developing biofuels, the government could look to develop nuclear powered freighters similar to the nuclear powered aircraft carriers, submarines, and ice breakers which already exist. Some of the same safety measures could be used as when transporting nuclear waste by ship . The NS Savannah, the first nuclear powered merchant vessel. It was largely experimental and suffered design issues unrelated to its engine. Source: US Government NARA (Public domain), via Wikimedia Commons. As a final note, there are also various non-energy related sources of greenhouse gases. Particular culprits are agriculture and the manufacture of steel and cement . These issues are beyond the scope of these articles, but it should be noted that they are not easy to solve. Furthermore, at present the greenhouse gases emitted in the production of Britain's imports are almost equal to those of Britain itself. Rebuilding Britain's manufacturing sector will help with this, but ultimately it represents the need for international action to fight climate change. As can be seen, the task of moving Britain over to a low-carbon economy is a Herculean one. It will require government intervention on an unprecedented scale. Only a left-wing government, armed with a detailed and carefully worked-out economic plan, can hope to achieve it in an equitable manner.","tags":"Energy British Politics Nuclear Power Heating Transport Climate Change","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/a-21st-century-energy-policy-part-3-the-technology-of-the-future.html","title":"A 21 st Century Energy Policy, Part 3: The Technology of the Future"},{"text":"I have written a series of four articles discussing Britain's energy policy for the left-wing Labour-supporting website Left Futures .

Various technologies which should be used and policies which should be enacted in order to improve energy efficiency and electrify heat and transport are discussed in Part 3 . Finally, Part 4 proposes an ownership framework capable of building the electricity infrastructure needed. As described in the previous article, renewable energy will not be able to provide the backbone of Britain's electricity supply. Geothermal power might provide a minority of the baseload capacity, it may be worth building new hydroelectric dams where possible, and there is a place for some intermittent energy capacity, but this still requires a substantial portion of the supply to come from another source. If fossil fuels must be abandoned 1 and renewable energy isn't up for the task, that leaves nuclear power. Nuclear power is, today, almost universally reviled by the left (with the notable exception of the Communist Party of France). It is viewed as dirty, dangerous, and expensive. The truth is, it need be none of these things. Much of the fear around nuclear power comes from not understanding the science and risks of radiation. It is notable that scientists tend not to be afraid of radiation and are significantly more in favour of building nuclear power plants than the general population. The fact of the matter is that the extra radiation experienced by people living near a nuclear power plant is insignificant in comparison to background radiation, as can be seen in the chart below. Radiation doses experienced from every-day activity, compared to those from nuclear accident and doses which are actually dangerous. Source: Randall Munroe, XKCD (follow link for larger image). The threat of accidents has also been greatly overblown. The major accidents which are cited are Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima. The consensus among peer-reviewed studies is that the Three Mile Island accident led to few or no deaths. The causes of the accident have been thoroughly investigated and reactor design and operating procedures have been improved as a result. Chernobyl, far and away the worst of these incidents, was the fault of a uniquely bad reactor design and a poorly executed experiment. RBMK reactors, such as the one at Chernobyl, are known to be unstable, had a control rod design which initially increases the reaction rate, are surrounded by flammable graphite, and lack the containment buildings seen in all other nuclear power plants. An accident like that at Chernobyl would not be physically possible in the types of reactors used in the West. Fukushima is the most recent of these and has resulted in a renewed backlash against nuclear power. It is important to remember that this event was initiated by an a 13m-15m tsunami resulting from a magnitude 9 earthquake, neither of which are events which can strike Britain . Furthermore, the private operator TEPCO had been cutting corners in terms of disaster preparedness. Clearly, strong independent oversight is needed for nuclear power and reactors should be in public ownership to make corner-cutting less likely. However, Fukushima is not an indictment of nuclear energy per se . No one died from radiation poisoning and any increase in cancer deaths looks set to be very small (even when using pessimistic models) and difficult to separate from background rates. As with Chernobyl, mental illness is a bigger threat to the effected population. Obviously every death is tragic, but no energy source is without risks . Despite its scary reputation, nuclear power has the lowest or second lowest number of deaths per gigawatt-hour of any energy source. When things go wrong, they tend to do so in a big, scary way, which misleads people as to the threat. New reactor designs (and, indeed, some older ones such as the CANDU ) include \"passive safety\" features which do not depend on human or electronic intervention, making accidents like those at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima physically impossible. The other big argument against nuclear power is what to do with the waste. It is important to keep this problem in perspective. Currently, only 25ml of high level nuclear waste (the stuff which needs to be stored for thousands of years) is produced per person, per year in Britain. Even if all of the UK 's present energy demands were met by nuclear, it would produce about a pint of high level waste per person, per year. This is a small volume to deal with when compared to other forms of waste. We can keep the waste in dry cask storage indefinitely as we look for longer-term solutions, so unlike GHG emissions this is not a pressing issue. Ultimately, burying nuclear waste deep in dry, geologically stable regions looks to be a viable solution. Furthermore, Generation IV reactor designs promise to be able to use existing nuclear waste as fuel and produce much lower volumes of their own waste. There is no denying that many nuclear projects have been expensive. New reactor designs have been known to go over-budget. On the other hand, while results of studies examining energy costs vary greatly ( see the Wikipedia article ), they tend to show that overall nuclear is of comparable cost to other energy sources. In recent years it can appear that renewable energy is cheaper, but these studies do not seem to take into account requirements for storage and changes to the electricity grid. Nuclear power plants have large capital costs and low operating costs, which means that building them in the private sector requires expensive subsidies. Nuclear-dependent France has middling to low electricity costs and demonstrates the savings which can be achieved by building reactors through a public sector energy monopoly to a standard design. In the future, small modular reactors could potentially be mass-produced, bringing prices down further. While no clean energy source is cheap, nuclear is likely to be the cheapest option for countries without hydroelectric or geothermal capacity. Hunterston B nuclear power plant in Scotland.

While most leftists are today opposed to nuclear energy, ironically it is only within a left-wing comprehensive economic plan that nuclear power can reach its full potential. The energy transition of France in the 1970s and 1980s shows what can be achieved by a state intent on transforming its power supply. For a country to prosper, it must have a clean, reliable, abundant energy supply and renewables alone will not provide this in Britain. If socialism is to bring prosperity, rather than a more equitable distribution of misery, our socialism must be nuclear powered. Carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) technology is sometimes invoked as a way for us to continue using fossil fuels. The issue with it is how we go about ensuring that the captured CO 2 stays where we put it . Usually it is suggested that it be stored underground, but were it to leak then it would undo all of our work capturing it in the first place. In many ways this is a more concerning problem even than nuclear waste, since the latter is solid—making it much easier to contain than a gas—and needs to be stored for only a finite time. ↩","tags":"Energy British Politics Nuclear Power Climate Change","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/a-21st-century-energy-policy-part-2-nuclear-powered-socialism.html","title":"A 21 st Century Energy Policy, Part 2: Nuclear Powered Socialism"},{"text":"I have written a series of four articles discussing Britain's energy policy for the left-wing Labour-supporting website Left Futures . In Part 1 I explain the limits of renewable energy sources. Part 2 advocates for the role of nuclear power in an energy transition. Various technologies which should be used and policies which should be enacted in order to improve energy efficiency and electrify heat and transport are discussed in Part 3 . Finally, Part 4 proposes an ownership framework capable of building the electricity infrastructure needed. With the exception of Arthur Scargill, most on the Left agree that the days of fossil fuels must soon come to an end. Whatever nostalgia some may have for the Miner's Strike, we all know that it would be environmental catastrophe to revive the coal industry. But if we are to wean ourselves off of coal and other fossil fuels, what will take their place? The answer which springs to everyone's lips is \"renewable energy\". Jeremy Corby has promised to have 65% of electricity coming from renewable sources by 2030, with a longer term goal of 85%. There is also a promise to phase out coal power plants by the early 2020s, strive to keep 80% of global fossil fuel reserves in the ground, and create 300 000 jobs in the renewable energy supply chain. All of this chimes well with the calls for a Green New Deal which have been coming from progressives since the financial crisis of 2008.

But there are two problems. First, it's not enough. Given that there are some sectors (such as agriculture, steel, and concrete production) which would be difficult or impossible to decarbonise, we must have greater reductions in greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions from electricity than 65, or even 85, percent. Ultimately, it will need to be 100% and it will need to be achieved as quickly as possible. Second of all, even a target of 65% renewable electricity is not achievable for Britain. To date, the following types of renewable energy have found extensive use: hydroelectric, wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. Of these, hydro, geothermal, and biomass energy are able to provide stable, base-load energy supplies. Hydro-power is the best-established of these technologies and provides the vast majority of electricity in Norway and parts of Canada. However, it requires specific geographical features to be viable. As such, only a few hundred megawatts of new hydro capacity could be built in England and Wales. Scotland has somewhat more potential, with a few gigawatts of new capacity possible, but only a fraction of this would be viable in practice. Furthermore, it is still only a few percent of the UK 's 50-60 gigawatt peak power consumption . The role of geothermal energy in the UK is unclear: a renewable industry group estimates that it could provide up to 20% of the country's current electricity needs and be used very effectively to heat homes, while others have suggested that it is an impractical power source for Britain. Even in the former case, however, other energy sources will be needed. Biomass power (largely consisting of burning wood-chips) is expensive and of dubious environmental benefit. While it is claimed to be \"carbon neutral\", this is untrue on the time scales relevant to mitigating global warming. In fact, it can release more GHGs than fossil fuels. That leaves solar power and wind. Given the relatively high latitude of the UK , general cloudiness, and fact that energy consumption is highest at the times of day and year with the least sunlight, solar panels are massively unfit as an energy source in this country. Furthermore, solar and wind are known as intermittent energy sources, as their output varies, often in an unpredictable manner. This makes them considerably more difficult to manage than conventional power plants. In an electricity system with other energy sources that can be turned on and off, intermittent energy sources could provide a significant minority of the supply. However, as their share grows, you begin to run the risk of brownouts. Thus, it becomes necessary to both build excess generating capacity and to build storage capacity. This way, when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing, some of the energy can be set aside for when it's dark and calm. Unfortunately, at present, we do not have technologies capable of economically delivering storage at the scale needed. Stepping back to examine the how vast this scale is , it is questionable if sufficient technology will ever exist. One of the standard responses to this is the suggestion of building a Europe-wide smart-grid. While this may help even out some of the most extreme troughs in generation, it is still insufficient. There is a great deal of correlation between wind-speeds across the continent, so that at times when the wind isn't blowing much in Italy, it also won't be blowing much in Denmark, Germany, the UK , or anywhere else on the continent. The net result is that for wind energy to be a major component of the electricity supply, massive amounts of more reliable generating capacity are also needed . The eye-catching headline about Germany generating the majority of its electricity from renewables on some day in July miss the point that it fails to generate this much on most other days. Given these problems, how have even existing levels of intermittent renewable energy proven economical? What about all the people and companies we hear about running completely off of renewable energy? While it is, strictly speaking, true that such customers are paying for all energy they consume to be produced by renewable sources, that is not to say that the electricity they use at a given time was from a renewable source. There would be times when they're consuming electricity generated from nuclear power or fossil fuels. It's just that at other times, the company they're buying energy from is producing more electricity than needed, which is then sold to other consumers, reducing the need for fossil fuel power plants at that time. This is all well and good for a consumer who wants to feel smug about their purchasing decisions, but isn't of much use if the goal is powering an entire country (let alone the world) with renewables. The carbon intensity of electricity across Europe, at 5: 30PM GMT January 28 2017. Germany and Denmark, darlings of renewable energy proselytisers, are mediocre at best. The countries with the cleanest electricity are Norway (hydro), Sweden (hydro and nuclear), and France (nuclear). Source: electricitymap.org Furthermore, despite the starry-eyed praise often heard for Germany's \"democratic\" energy system, the truth is less than pretty. It is true that a number of municipalities have bought back their energy grids and that there are a number of energy co-ops. However, the vast majority of the renewable capacity is owned by private companies and individuals . The feed-in tariffs used to incentivise investment in renewable energy are set well above market energy prices and have led to the highest or second highest energy prices in Europe, while enriching investors and those well-off enough to own a home on which to install solar panels. And yet, Jeremy Corbyn slammed the Conservatives for cutting feed-in tariffs . Worse, the actual reductions in GHG emissions is underwhelming. Assuming that Germany meets its targets ( which is dubious ), it plans for 80% of electricity to be renewable by 2050. On the other hand, France was able to move a similar proportion of its electricity production to low-carbon sources in a decade . Most damming of all, there simply are not enough renewable energy sources in Britain to meet our needs. To come close would require using every available technology (many of which are unproven or expensive) and massive amounts of land. There would be essentially no remaining wilderness and generating capacity would need to intrude massively upon living areas. More realistic estimates suggest that renewables can provide just a fraction of Britain's power. All of this makes renewables insufficient if our goal is to decarbonise our energy production. The problem becomes even worse when considering that currently electricity makes up only 20% of Britain's energy usage. Even with efficiency gains, electricity production will have to grow massively if it is to heat homes, fuel cars, and power trains, and it does not appear that renewables are up for the task. Much of the appeal of renewable energy seems to come from a \"small is beautiful\" approach to electricity production. Many people find the idea of having a distributed energy system made up of individuals, small businesses, and co-operatives to be appealing. It only goes to show how much neoliberalism has altered the left's thinking, that this is considered a progressive approach. A market of many small producers has more in common with Adam Smith than with any strain of socialist thought. Such a policy would be insufficient to fight climate change, not be able to provide a reliable electricity supply, and enrich a few well-to-do owners of solar panels and wind farms at the cost of higher electricity prices for everyone else.","tags":"Energy British Politics Renewables Climate Change","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/a-21st-century-energy-policy-part-1-all-thats-wrong-with-renewables.html","title":"A 21 st Century Energy Policy, Part 1: All that's Wrong with Renewables"},{"text":"The left-wing extremest/Leader of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition Here's something you won't hear everyday: I'm to the left of Jeremy Corbyn . If you listened to much of the British media, you wouldn't think that's possible, given that the now twice-elected leader of the Labour Party is apparently a Lenin-loving, Hamas-hugging, business-bashing commie fiend dead-set on nationalising your children and making them go on strike in reopened coal mines. And yet, here I am, proudly nailing my colours to the mast, revealing them to being considerably redder than those of certain bearded Bolshevik. In all seriousness, anyone who is actually paying attention to what Corbyn has been saying and is being intellectually honest will have to admit that his politics aren't that radical. He's promised significant public investment, a move away from fossil fuels, faster Internet connections, stronger collective bargaining, and a number of other extremely welcome measures which nonetheless would keep Britain a firmly capitalism society. The only industry which he's promised to nationalise is rail, which is so obviously sensible that even a majority of Tory voters support it, and possibly portions of the bus network. This barely scratches the surface of the nationalisations overseen by Clem Attlee's postwar Labour government, let alone the sorts of proposals put forward by Tony Benn ( de facto leader of the Labour Left) in the 1970s and ‘80s. This is not to say that I don't think that, at heart, Corbyn is considerably more radical than his policies suggest, but his actual platform is some way to the right of what I'd like. But I'm not writing this simply to moan about Corbyn being too moderate or betraying his roots or anything like that. I get that he is in a difficult position where he has to put forward policy which can win elections, hold the Labour Party together, and successfully be implemented without insurmountable resistance from the civil service or military . At some point compromises are going to be made and some of those are not going to be ones which I'll find acceptable. A case in point is the recent move of some of those around the leadership to get behind the renewal of the Trident nuclear weapons 1 . I get that this may be seen as a necessary compromise if they are to pursue their agenda of democratising the economy. At the same time, though, I can not in any way support any policy which would see tens, if not hundreds, of billions of pounds spent on weapons of mass destruction. It would be bad enough keeping the weapons if they were already built and just sitting there, but it is utterly unconscionable to actually be spending the money to build them yourself. Yes, the renewal will likely be underway by the time Labour could hypothetically be elected, but it will not be finished, will still be costing money, and could still be stopped. One of the problems we now face is that the Labour Party now has no left wing. Most people would look at me very strangely indeed for saying that, given that one of its most left wing MPs is now the leader. What I mean is that there is now no one to the left of the leader who can hold him to account and act as the party's conscience. Having an uncompromising left block in parliament is important because it is able to act as a counterweight on the leadership when it is under pressure from business, the civil service, or the international community to abandon its goals. This is similar to the problem experienced in places like Bolivia and Greece where the most capable left-wing organisers ended up being drawn into the state, with little capacity for independent organising left. Ideally this could be a role played by the membership, or at least a subset of it. However, most of the new members are left-progressive types rather than hard-core socialists (let-alone the Trotskyists that the media would have us believe no run the party). These are people who would have voted Green or Plaid Cymru or SNP or even Lib-Dem in previous elections and are not familiar with the detailed socialist analysis 2 . I don't mean to be condescending to these people, as socialists must be able to reach out to them and convince them, but my point is that quite a bit of work is required before much of the membership is likely to be able to act as a significant counterweight to right-wing pressure on the leadership. The fact that much of the politics of these new members seems to be based around supporting Corbyn will also make it more difficult for them to apply pressure on him when necessary. Many of the left-wing currents within labour are not helping with this. While they could be staking out a space to develop the left policy they want, without having to worry so much about not antagonising the Labour Right, instead their approach seems to be to provide uncritical support to the leadership and its policies. The Jeremy Corbyn for PM Facebook page seems to consist mainly of praising whatever the leadership says, while Momentum has been little more than a Jeremy Corbyn fan club. Both display a slightly revolting level of sycophancy and hero-worship. This must not continue. We on the left must not be afraid to publicly disagree with the leadership if they are doing something which we consider to be wrong. Motions should be put forward to conference calling for more radical actions than Corbyn has been willing to discuss so far. I'm not saying that we should just propose whatever we want, regardless of its practicality or ability to get traction with the electorate. There's no point trying to get a demand for collective ownership of the means of production and distribution into the next Labour manifesto 3 or to propose budgets using misleading figures. We still need to consider what is achievable, but if our opinion on this differs from that of the leadership (as mine does in many cases) then we should not be afraid to say so. Jeremy Corbyn's positions should not represent the limit of left wing policy. The reference to NATO a collectivist, internationalist organisation during this speech also really took the cake. ↩ By which I mean a materialist approach to history and society, with all that this entails. ↩ But stating this as a long term goal in the party constitution , on the other hand… ↩","tags":"UK Labour Corbyn British Politics Nuclear Weapons","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/no-limits-on-the-left.html","title":"No Limits on the Left"},{"text":"Well, the vote was for Brexit. I am stating this as a fact, not meaning to place any particular mourning or celebration in it. I can't say I'm a fan of the EU . I think it is neoliberal and unaccountable, probably irredeemably so in both cases. But I take no joy in the outcome of this vote. The narrative leading to Brexit was not one of building a better future based on cooperation, without the constant calls for greater \"competitiveness\". Instead, it was a narrative of out-of-control immigration, the interfering outsiders, Britain no longer being Great thanks to the burdens of the EU . It was not a pleasant campaign for those of us on the Left. Let me be clear: I am a believer in democratic European federalism. However, I have serious doubts that the EU can ever become such a system, given its extreme democratic deficit. At best, I think that a set of countries, which would likely need to be lead by Leftist governments, would essentially secede from the EU at once to form some other institution. More likely, any such government would be forced out of the EU if it tried to implement a serious Leftist program, long before a coordinated secession could be achieved. I don't think the EU will ever be a conducive battleground for Leftist ideas. So, this leaves us in a depressing state. The exit vote was driven by right-wing narratives, while staying would have locked us into a neoliberal framework. I knew this was the choice ahead of us long before the vote occurred. We were faced only with bad outcomes. Given that, I won't condemn anyone on the Left for their choices, whether they voted to leave, remain, spoiled their ballot, or abstained. I knew that, however they voted, Leftists were not motivated by racism or nationalism but by a genuine concern for building a better world. I knew that, regardless of the result of the vote, we were going to need to fight harder than ever to build international solidarity, to develop coherent policies for a socialist program, to bring the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dispossessed Britons and Europeans into the struggle for a better future. Well, the vote was for Brexit. We have to accept that. We don't have to like it or agree with it, but we have to accept it. Calling the people who voted for it stupid, or racists, or saying that you're ashamed to be British isn't going to do any good. In fact, it will only alienate the Brexit voters—who we'll need if the Left is ever to get elected—even more. Today may well have been a defeat for the Left, but the Left has had almost nothing but defeats in this country (or anywhere else) since 1979. We know how to keep on going. Raging against the outcome won't help us do that. The Brexit vote happened. We don't yet know what the final resolution to this story will be, but we have to do everything in our power to ensure that our future outside of the European Union is as just and humane as possible. Note: My reaction to the vote on leaving the EU was confusing and complex. This was an attempt to put it into words. I'm not entirely satisfied with what I've written; I feel like I could have been more eloquent and have perhaps missed a few points. Nonetheless, I've managed to clarify and codify at least some of my thoughts on this confusing issue.","tags":"UK EU British Politics Europe Brexit","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/you-dont-have-to-like-brexit-but-you-do-have-to-live-with-it.html","title":"You Don't Have to Like Brexit, But You do Have to Live With it"},{"text":"Edit: Once the initial disappointment was over, I was able to step back and appreciate that this was a rather infantile post. While I stand by my comments that Tsipras was naive and feel that, if they weren't going to use it to fight back against the EU , calling the referendum was ultimately harmful because of the ensuing economic turmoil, name calling such as this is not very helpful. On the other hand, I don't wish to erase history, so I have decided to leave the post up, but with this disclaimer. January 21, 2016 So it's come to this. After my fierce criticism a few weeks ago , Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras briefly managed to redeem himself somewhat in my opinion by calling a referendum on the (incredibly bad) deal which Greece had been offered and asking people to vote \"no\" (\"oxi,\" in Greek). As the population was scared of the possibility of being forced out of the Euro, everyone expected the result to be close and no one was sure which way it would go. Much to everyone's surprise, Greeks gave \"oxi\" a landslide victory of over 60%. Finally, I thought, Tsipras might actually play hardball with Europe. One of the few remotely unflattering pictures of Greek PM Alexis Tsipras Of course, Europe took no notice. They told him he had until midnight Wednesday to submit a \"credible\" proposal for a deal, or Europe would begin preparing for Greece's departure from the Eurozone (the so-called \"Grexit\"). So now Tsipras has submitted a proposal for a deal that is objectively worse than the one rejected in the referendum. There is a lot that I could say about this. I could mention how incredibly naive Tsipras and the leadership of his party ( SYRIZA ) were. I could mention how incompetent there were when it came to planning for other eventualities. I could question why they even held a referendum if this was to be the result. But I'm too frustrated to form a coherent blog post about that. In any case, it has already been said by others, both SYRIZA members and international sympathizers . What I have to say is much simpler, far more puerile, and infinitely more satisfying: Alexis Tsipras, go to Hell! Seriously, FUCK OFF TO HELL , YOU FUCKING QUISLING BASTARD ! I want you to starve to death on the poverty income that nearly half of all Greek pensioners are receiving. I want you to feel the despair and hopelessness which has caused a 35% increase in suicides since the beginnings of austerity. I want you to go down in history as a traitor to your cause, more reviled by your party than even Ramsay MacDonald was in Britain. It may well be true that the situation is complex and there are reasons for what you did. But I don't care. I want you chained to a rock where buzzards will peck out your liver each morning for the rest of eternity. Or perhaps you could be made to push a bolder up a hill every day, only to have it roll back down just before reaching the summit. Barring that, I at least want you kicked out of your party and force from office.","tags":"Austerity Greece SYRIZA Alexis Tsipras Rant","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/tsipras-go-to-hell.html","title":"Tsipras, go to Hell"},{"text":"Just over five months ago, Greece elected a new government lead by left-wing party SYRIZA . SYRIZA comes out of a radical tradition rejecting both reformist social democracy and authoritarian communism and was swept to power on a wave of anti-austerity sentiment. Austerity refers to the massive cuts to public spending (tending to hurt particularly those on lower incomes) which Greece has endured over the past five years, along with the associated policies of deregulation, cuts to the minimum wage, an end to collective bargaining, and the privatization of anything which actually makes a profit for the government. These policies have been devastating for Greece, resulting in a 26% contraction in GDP , ~25% unemployment, over 50% youth unemployment, and a humanitarian disaster as people can't get access to food, energy, shelter, or basic healthcare. 1 Now, it is fair to say that Greece did borrow too much money over the years leading up to the crisis. However, I think it is also fair to say that there is an inverse relationship between someone's culpability for the debt and the pain which they have experienced under austerity. It is also true that the Greek state is hopelessly corrupt. That said, of all of the parties represented in the Hellenic Parliament, SYRIZA is probably the one with the greatest commitment to try to tack that. Anyway, none of this is new—it was all equally the case when SYRIZA was elected in January. At that time, SYRIZA had pledged to end austerity while staying a part of the Eurozone and refraining from any unilateral actions (i.e. defaulting on the debt). Given that Greeks overwhelmingly favour staying in the Euro, it is not surprising that SYRIZA would make such a commitment. They insisted that they would be able to reverse austerity by: Immediately implementing the Thessaloniki Program which purported to provide a mild Keynseianism with the resources already available to the Greek government. Renegotiating the debt with Europe, on the basis that austerity clearly was not leading to growth and was hurting the Eurozone as a whole. Furthermore, they would point out that there was no way that Greece would ever be able to repay the debt as the situations currently stands, whether they want to or not. However, it almost immediately 2 became clear to anyone who was watching with a remotely level head that this would not be as easy as was claimed. The leadership of SYRIZA are die-hard Europeans who, reportedly, believe in the European project (European integration which, in reality, means the EU and the Euro) at a deep emotional level. They were thus extremely reluctant to countenance any sort of break with Europe, even without considering that public opinion took a similar view. It would thus appear that they genuinely thought that, if they were to sit down and explain to the EU why austerity was wrong-headed then it would see the light. Now, I certainly would not condemn giving this a try—after all, what have they got to loose? But I found it incredibly hard to believe that they would go into these quixotic negotiations without even a sketch of an alternative plan to pursue if they failed. And yet that is what seems to be the case. In February, prompted by the potential collapse of the Greek banking sector, Athens signed a deal with the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (previously called \"the Troika,\" since renamed \"the institutions\" or \"the Brussels group\" for reasons of political spin) in order to ensure that the European Central Bank would keep it afloat. However, this deal represented a major retreat from their election promises, as it committed them to austerity (with vague enough language that SYRIZA naively hoped that they could wriggle out of it) and forbade them from passing any legislation which could, in the view of \"the institutions,\" endanger the Greek \"recovery.\" The worst part of all of this was that the SYRIZA leadership tried to portray this as a victory and proof that it was possible to negotiate a resolution with Europe. However, since that time, Greece has not actually seen any of the money that they were promised from the Troika, as they must first start to implement the structural adjustments demanded. This has left Athens with very little money to make repayments on various loans coming due and, over the past few month, the government has been drained of any remaining cash. With a major repayment due to the IMF at the end of June, things were getting desperate. In an attempt to get access to the funds that they had been promised, the Greek government began backsliding on ever more of their promises. A call to halt (and even reverse) privatizations gave way to pursuing \"partnerships\" with the private sector to develop state assets, to partial privatization, to privatization full-stop. Commitments to restore pensions to their previous levels became a promise not to decrease them further. Promises to reduce sales tax have turned into pledges not to raise it on essential items. A goal of running balanced budgets (rather than a surplus) became a request to simply run a smaller surplus. And any talk of a comprehensive investment plan to spur growth has vanished. SYRIZA 's insistence that there were certain red lines which they would not cross looked ever more dubious. And now, at the eleventh hour, SYRIZA has given way on their pledges to protect pensions and not to raise sales tax. They've even succumbed to calls for a higher budget surplus. To be honest, I'm somewhat surprised by this; I had expected that if they were going to give in on those issues then they would have done it before now. All I can conclude is that the leadership really didn't know what it was doing and had persisted in the blind belief that Europe was bluffing and would give in if they waited long enough. But to anyone with half a brain it should have been obvious that this was a delusion, at least after the agreement in February. For SYRIZA 's Left Platform, this has long been the case. Prominent members have consistently been calling for a break with Europe since February. Economist and SYRIZA MP Costas Lapavitsas has been urging an exit from the Eurozone since before the election and has drawn up plans for how this could be accomplished. A growing number of people on the left of SYRIZA 's mainstream faction have also been won over to this view after having witnessed the ever greater concessions which have been offered in order to avoid rupture with Europe. However, none of this has affected the official discourse of the party and, as such, the Greek public has been fed the delusion that relief from austerity is possible within the Euro and support for some sort of compromise—which, seeing as SYRIZA has given way on virtually all of its initial bargaining positions while the institutions have given way on hardly any, is impossible. The end result: Greeks remain totally unprepared for any sort of rupture with Europe, having been scared stiff by the media and pandering SYRIZA politicians of the consequences of doing anything which might endanger their place in the Euro. So, what now? Well, there are still questions over whether a deal will actually be reached. But if it is, SYRIZA 's leaders will still need to sell it to the rest of the party. And it is not at all clear that this will happen. While it may get the support of a majority of the cabinet, there is every sign that SYRIZA 's coalition partner will reject it (especially if it involves hikes to sales tax) and I suspect that at least 20% of SYRIZA 's own MPs would vote against it. This would be enough to make SYRIZA rely on the support of opposition parties to pass such a bill, which would be humiliating and would damage the party's image. Furthermore, it remains a distinct possibility that the party's central committee will vote down accepting any such deal. A few weeks ago there was a vote on a motion to break with Europe, which lost 75-95. That means only 11 committee members would have to swing in order for such a proposal to win now. Given the scope of SYRIZA 's retreat, such a result would seem entirely possible. Then there is the prospect of discontent in the party grassroots. Already the youth wing has held protests indicating that they would prefer \"chaos to capitulation\" . So a split in the SYRIZA ranks is looking increasingly likeley. Now, onto the point which caused me to write this article: how should the international Left respond to these developments? For months socialist across Europe have been expressing solidarity with Greeks and the Greek government, while upstart parties have been advertising themselves as the Spanish / British / Turkish SYRIZA . Should they continue to offer SYRIZA their unconditional support? Should they condemn this retreat? It's a tricky question, made all the harder by these groups' uncritical approach to SYRIZA over the past while. Billing yourself as a party in the image of SYRIZA will be distinctly damaging if SYRIZA is forced to retreat. I think it's fair to say that we on the Left must continue to offer the Greek people our solidarity. However, no such solidarity should be extended to any SYRIZA member who is willing to implement austerity. Fair enough, they are in an incredibly difficult situation and it is all too easy for us to criticize when we can't even imagine being able to form a government in our home countries. But the fact remains, if we are to be at all consistent then we must not endorse anyone who implements austerity, whether they come from a left-wing background or not. So what should SYRIZA do? From the comfort of my armchair in a country which has not been ravaged by austerity and is safely on its own currency and who won't be hurt if things go wrong, here are my thoughts. For starters, they should get rid of their leader, Alexis Tsipras, finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, and the inner circle which surrounds them. This group has clearly revealed themselves to be incapable of pushing back austerity in Greece, let alone of laying the ground for overcoming capitalism. At the very least, Varoufakis should be forced to resign. Next comes the problem that SYRIZA does not have a mandate for breaking with Europe. As I said earlier, they were elected promising to end austerity while remaining in the Eurozone. However, nor do they have any mandate to implement austerity as they look prepared to do. I'm not totally adverse to the concept of pushing ahead and breaking with austerity, leaving the Euro if necessary, mandate be damned. To be sure, such an approach has risks, but I can't help but feel that those risks are better than the certainty of austerity-induced misery within the Euro. In all probability, this will require a fresh election or a referendum in order to justify it to the electorate. What's more, there is a very good chance that SYRIZA would lose such an election and it would almost certainly lose such a referendum. Well, so be it. If the Greek people decide that they would prefer austerity over leaving the Euro, then SYRIZA should resign. Let a party which really believes in austerity be the one to implement it. SYRIZA would be better off in opposition, agitating for an end to austerity even if it does mean a break with Europe. This would be a serious setback but, unlike giving in to austerity, not a fatal one. Let SYRIZA live to fight another day. Sorry I haven't provided any references here.

Previously I was using a modified version of the Gum theme , but I wanted one which was all my own. I also decided that I wanted a distinctly different look for my blog, using serif fonts and darker colours. Years of procrastination finally came to an end when I knew that I would need to design such a theme for a professional website (I'll post more on that once it's finished) and thought I might as well design a similar blog theme while I was at it. You can find the theme on GitHub . You may also notice that I have a new favicon (shown here at higher resolution). This is the silhouette of one of Oxford's many \"dreaming spires.\" For those of you who don't know, I'll be starting my graduate studies at Oxford this fall. As I quite like Oxford's nickname as \"the city of dreaming spires,\" I decided that this would be a nice symbol for my blog. Incidentally, that silhouette was traced from the image to the right (or on the bottom, depending on your screen size). While I was at it, I got around to updating various pages on this website. I have added a more detailed About page, provided an up-to-date listing of software that I have written, and changed the Technical page to more accurately represent how the blog now works. I have also reorganized the categories I give articles, eliminating the two which had the fewest articles. As a note, those articles were not deleted—simply folded into other categories. The main motivation for this was simply to ensure that everything fit well on the navigation bar. Next year I will be moving back into residence for grad school and thus won't be able to run a server on which to host my blog. In preparation for this, I decided to move it to GitHub pages. This will likely also be (at least temporarily) the host of my professional website, once it is completed. Most importantly, I decided to change the name of my blog from Red Shades of Green . I had originally chosen that title in order to reflect that I was concerned about the environment, but that I was a bit of a pinko. Since then, I feel that I have become much more stridently left-wing and, at the same time, have lost a certain amount of patience with the environmental movement and the behaviour of ecosocialists. Not to say that I care about the environment any less; I simply take a different approach to the issue than I used to 1 . One which is more firmly pro-technology. And one which integrates environmental issues into socialism, rather than the other way around. I suppose these days a more accurate title would be Green Shades of Red . Instead I went with The Political Physicist . At risk of explaining the obvious, this is a play on political science. As a scientist (well, a student scientist) who cares deeply about politics, you might say that I'm a political scientist. However, this makes it sound like I study political science, rather than physics. And the rest, as they say, is history. But while the appearance, location, and name of my blog has changed, none of the content has really. I will still write my extremely biased political articles. I will still complain about petty things, like the use of the phrase \"growing exponentially,\" and I'll still write in great detail about programming and software despite the fact that most of my audience can't understand a thing I say about it. Even as I prepare to travel across the ocean to spend the next three years in grad school, studying a totally different branch of physics from what I have so far, I am still essentially the same person and that fact is reflected here. As I enter this new chapter of my life, I invite you all to share the adventure with me, knowing that, in all probability, at the end of it I will be just as neurotic, pedantic, and idealistic as I am today. And have come to accept that I will never quite see eye-to-eye with ecosocialists on a number of issues. ↩","tags":"Blogging HTML CSS Foundation Pelican","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/blog-rebooted.html","title":"Blog, Rebooted"},{"text":"Well, it's that time of year again. The good people at Bell, through their Let's Talk campaign, are once again donating money to mental health initiatives. All they ask in return is that we spread the word by sharing their posts about it on Facebook. Isn't that nice of them? The Let's Talk ad Well, no, it's not, on several levels. First and foremost, if they really care about mental health then surely they can just donate the money anyway, rather than only do so if people share their Facebook posts. Which let's us know that mental health is not what they really care about here. As, I suspect, with most corporate donations, the real motivation is how it will effect their image. Donating to charity will make them appear to be generous and good corporate citizens, at least to those who are less cynical than me. Presumably they feel that this will make people slightly more likely to choose them over Rogers (or whatever other company you decide on from the myriad of—pardon me, virtually no —other choices that exist in Canada). But here Bell are exceptionally clever. In addition to the usual posturing you get when a company donates to a good cause, this campaign is all about providing Bell with advertising. It's built into the model, as the more people who share Bell's post, the more money they will donate. They say that for every time their post is shared they will donate 5 cents to mental health initiatives. According to one website, it costs about 25 cents to reach 1000 people on Facebook. That means that each person sharing the Bell post would only need 201 friends in order for this to be cheaper. 1 This is far cheaper than advertising in conventional media, or even most other online media. Furthermore, these shared Bell posts will not be susceptible to adblocking software, as normal Facebook advertising is. So, we've established that Bell is not doing this out of the kindness of their heart, but because of the positive impact on their brand and the advertising which it generates. But surely we can still be happy about the positive outcome, regardless of the motives behind it? Well, in a sense I suppose we should, as this money is certainly better spent on mental health initiatives than on returns to shareholders. But then again, we shouldn't. If Bell feels that it has this money to give away, then to me that indicates that they aren't being taxed enough. If they were then the revenue could be used by the government to provide mental health initiative directly. Moreover, it would be under our democratic control to decide if this is, indeed, the best way to spend it. Maybe we'd decide that there is some other health concern which would be a better use of the money. As it stand now, we have no choice in the matter. You might ask why we should have a choice. After all, it's Bell's money. But where does Bell get it's money from? Consumers, of course. So it's all of our money really. That means that we should have a say over how it's spent. 2 Furthermore, as a way of collecting money to provide services, this is highly regressive. Why should the amount that we spend on telecom determine how much we contribute towards mental health initiatives? Shouldn't those who have more money be contributing a greater percentage of their income? This is the approach we take to taxation, after all. This argument, of course, applies to all corporate charity. Given this, surely the best way to fund things like mental health initiatives is via taxation. So, Bell, if you want to help contribute that money to good causes, why don't you give it to the government? They can spend it as necessary. Better yet, you could let yourself be voluntarily nationalized, so that telecom could be provided at cost, or even for free. Let this essential service, like those surrounding mental health, be funded progressively. In fairness, that is probably rather optimistic, as there is plenty of overlap between people's groups of friends. Nonetheless, it's pretty good value. ↩ If you feel tempted to argue that this logic applies to any way in which a company spends its money, then I agree. That is why I'm a socialist and believe in public ownership. ↩","tags":"Charity Democracy Accountability Advertising Telecom","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/lets-talk-about-bell.html","title":"Let's Talk About Bell"},{"text":"Over Christmas break I've been working on this project to produce documentation for Fortran programs. I've (just) managed to finish it before school starts again! Here is the README for it, containing the documentation which I wrote. You can find the code on Github . This is an automatic documentation generator for modern Fortran programs. FORD stands for FORtran Documenter. As you may know, \"to ford\" refers to crossing a river (or other body of water). It does not, in this context, refer to any company or individual associated with cars. Ford was written due to Doxygen ‘s poor handling of Fortran and the lack of comparable alternatives. ROBODoc can't actually extract any information from the source code and just about any other automatic documentation software I found was either proprietary, didn't work very well for Fortran, or was limited in terms of how it produced its output. f90doc is quite good and I managed to modify it so that it could handle most of Fortran 2003, but it produces rather ugly documentation, can't provide as many links between different parts of the documentation as I'd like, and is written in Perl (which I'm not that familiar with and which lacks the sort of libraries found in Python for producing HTML content). The goal of FORD is to be able to reliably produce documentation for modern Fortran software which is informative and nice to look at. The documentation should be easy to write and non-obtrusive within the code. While it will never be as feature-rich as Doxygen, hopefully FORD will be able to provide an alternative for documenting Fortran projects. Disclaimer This is a young project. While it has bee tested somewhat, the testing has been far from comprehensive. Various options have not been tested and obscure uses of the Fortran syntax could still potentially cause FORD to crash. If you get an error message while processing a file, first check to make sure that the file actually compiles. No effort has been made to be able to process files which contain syntax errors. Next ensure that you aren't using any of the lingering FORTRAN77 syntax. If you are still experiencing errors, comment out the try / except statement on lines 59-63 of ./ford/fortran_project.py. Leave only line 60 uncommented. You will probably need to remove four spaces from line 60's indentation, as well. This will give you a proper Python backtrace. Submit a bug report on this Github page, including the backtrace and, if possible, the file which FORD crashed while processing. If an error occurs elsewhere, you will most likely get a backtrace by default. Once again, please include this backtrace in your bug report. Dependencies In addition to the standard Python libraries, the following modules are needed: Jinja2 Pygments toposort Markdown A near-term goal will be to write a setup script which will check for these dependencies and install those which are missing. I'd also like to make FORD available on PyPI so that all dependencies will be installed automatically. Basic Usage FORD usage is based on projects . A project is just whatever piece of software you want to document. Normally it would either be a program or a library. Each project will have its own Markdown file which contains a description of the project. Various options (see below for a description) can be specified in this file, such as where to look for your projects source files, where to output the documentation, and information about the author. Running Ford Once you have written a project file which you're satisfied with, it is time to run FORD . Make sure that it is in the path/Python-path. The most basic syntax for running ford is just ford project-file.md Assuming that there are no errors, your documentation will now be available in the path you indicated for output. Writing Documentation All documentation, both that provided within the source files and that given in the project file, should be written in Markdown . In addition to the standard Markdown syntax, you can use all of the features in Python's Markdown Extra . Other Markdown extensions automatically loaded are CodeHilite which will provide syntax highlighting for any code fragments you place in your documentation, SmartyPants which gives the typographically correct version of various characters, and Meta-Data . The latter is used internally as a way for the user to provide extra information to and/or customize the behaviour of FORD . Information on providing meta-data and what types of data FORD will look for can be found in the next section. In modern (post 1990) Fortran, comments are indicated by an exclamation mark (!). FORD will ignore a normal comment like this. However, comments with two exclamation marks (!!) are interpreted as documentation and will be captured for inclusion in the output. FORD documentation must come after whatever it is that you are documenting, either at the end of the line or on a subsequent line. This was chosen because it was felt it is easier to make your documentation readable from within the source-code this way. This subroutine feed_pets ( cats , dogs , food , angry ) !! Feeds your cats and dogs, if enough food is available. If not enough !! food is available, some of your pets will get angry. ! Arguments integer , intent ( in ) :: cats !! The number of cats to keep track of. integer , intent ( in ) :: dogs !! The number of dogs to keep track of. real , intent ( inout ) :: food !! The ammount of pet food (in kilograms) which you have on hand. integer , intent ( out ) :: angry !! The number of pets angry because they weren't fed. !... return end subroutine feed_pets looks better/more readable than !! Feeds your cats and dogs, if enough food is available. If not enough !! food is available, some of your pets will get angry. subroutine feed_pets ( cats , dogs , food , angry ) ! Arguments !! The number of cats to keep track of. integer , intent ( in ) :: cats !! The number of dogs to keep track of. integer , intent ( in ) :: dogs !! The ammount of pet food (in kilograms) which you have on hand. real , intent ( inout ) :: food !! The number of pets angry because they weren't fed. integer , intent ( out ) :: angry !... return end subroutine feed_pets in the opinion of this author, especially with regards to the list of arguments. Unfortunately, if you disagree, it is unlikely that there will ever be a switch available to change this behaviour, as it would require a drastic rewrite of large parts of the structure of the code. Please note that legacy Fortran (fixed-form code) is not supported at this time. If anyone would like to contribute the necessary modifications to ./ford/reader.py to convert fixed-form syntax into free-form, it should not be difficult (see the approach taken by f90doc ). However, it is not a priority for me at this time (since I regard fixed-form Fortran as an abomination which should be wiped from the face of this Earth). Output Output is in HTML . By default, all links will be relative, meaning that the output can be placed and viewed anywhere. The Bootstrap framework was used to make it easy to quickly design professional looking pages. An example of some output from my project Futility is shown below. Some example output. Options While not nearly as configurable as the likes of Doxygen , FORD 's output can still be customized to some extent by users. Command-Line Options The command-line interface is given below: ford.py [-h] [-d PROJECT_DIRECTORY] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-s CSS] [--exclude EXCLUDE] [-e [EXTENSIONS [EXTENSIONS ...]]] project_file PROJECT_DIRECTORY The directory where the source-files are to be found for this project. This must not be a subdirectory of the OUTPUT_DIR (see below). OUTPUT_DIR The directory where the project output will be placed. Any content already present there will be deleted. CSS The path to a custom style-sheet which can be used to modify the appearance of the output. EXCLUDE A source file which should not be read. If you want to specify more than one then you will need to do it in the project file. EXTENSIONS File extensions which will be read by FORD for documentation. ( default: f90, f95, f03, f08) project_file The file containing a description of your project and various settings for FORD . Settings specified at the command-line will override those specified in the project file. Project File Options You can specify various options and information for your project in the meta-data of your project file. Quoting from the Markdown Meta-Data page: Meta-data consists of a series of keywords and values defined at the beginning of a markdown document like this: Title: My Document Summary: A brief description of my document. Authors: Waylan Limberg John Doe Date: October 2, 2007 blank-value: base_url: http://example.com This is the first paragraph of the document. The keywords are case-insensitive and may consist of letters, numbers, underscores and dashes and must end with a colon. The values consist of anything following the colon on the line and may even be blank. If a line is indented by 4 or more spaces, that line is assumed to be an additional line of the value for the previous keyword. A keyword may have as many lines as desired. The first blank line ends all meta-data for the document. Therefore, the first line of a document must not be blank. All meta-data is stripped from the document prior to any further processing by Markdown. The options which can be specified in the meta-data are listed below. Defaults are included in the description, if they exist. project The name of this project. ( default: Fortran Project) summary A summary of the description of your project. If present it will be printed in a \"Jumbotron\" element at the top of the documentation index page. This will be processed by Markdown before being used. project_url The URL at which the documentation will be available. If left blank then relative URLs will be used for links. ( default: blank, i.e. relative links) project_directory The directory where the source-files are to be found for this project. This must not be a subdirectory of the output_dir (see below). ( default: ./src) output_dir The directory where the project output will be placed. Any content already present there will be deleted. css The path to a custom style-sheet which can be used to modify the appearance of the output. ( default: ./doc) extensions File extensions which will be read by FORD for documentation. Each extension must be on its own line. ( default: f90, f95, f03, f08) exclude A source file which should not be read. Each excluded file must be on its own line. Provide only the file name, not the full path. display How much documentation should be printed. Options are ‘public', ‘private', ‘protected', or any combination of those three. Each choice must be on its own line. ( default: ‘public' and ‘protected') version The version name/number of your project. year The year to display in the copyright notice. ( default: the current year) project_github The URL of the Github repository for this project. project_bitbucket The URL of the BitBucket repository for this project. project_sourceforge The Sourceforge repository for this project. project_download A URL from which to download the source or binaries for this project. project_website The homepage for this project. author The name of the person(s) or organization who wrote this project. author_description A brief description of the author. You could provide biographical details or links to other work, for example. This will be processed by Markdown before being used. author_pic A picture of or avatar for the author. github The author's Github page. bitbucket The author's BitBucket page. facebook The author's Facebook profile. twitter The author's Twitter. google_plus The author's Google+ linkedin The author's LinkedIn profile. email The author's email address. website The author's website. Meta-Data in Documentation When documenting your source files you can provide meta-data at the top of an item's documentation. There can not be any other documentation before it; not even a blank line of documentation. This will work ! Good type :: cat !! author: A Fortran Programmer !! version: v0.2 !! !! This data-type represents a cat. but this won't ! Bad type :: cat !! !! author: A Fortran programmer !! version: v0.2 !! !! This data-type represents a cat. The meta-data will be displayed for procedures, derived types, files, programs, modules, type-bound procedures, and interfaces. It may be displayed in more cases in future. Recognized types of meta-data are: author The author of this part of the code date The date that this part of the code was written (or that the documentation was written; whichever makes more sense to you). license The license for this part of your code. If you want to provide a link then it will have to be in HTML , as it won't be processed by Markdown. version The version number (or name) of this part of the code. category A category for this part of the code. Currently this is fairly useless, just being printed in the documentation. In future, FORD may provide lists of things in each category. summary A brief description of this part of the code. If not specified then FORD will use the first paragraph of the body of your documentation. deprecated If this is present and not \"False\" then a label saying \"Deprecated\" will be placed in the documentation. ToDo This software is still extremely young and much remains to be done. Various things which I'd like to do at some point include: Support some of the old Fortran 77 ways of doing things, as these are often still used. This includes PARAMETER statements and EXTERNAL statements. Support for fixed-form code is less of a priority. Add the ability to produce dependency diagrams and inheritance diagrams for modules and types, respectively. Make more options configurable from the command-line. Integrate the Pelican MathJax plugin. Add MathJax support. Priority Task Add a search feature. Test on some more code, including that of other people, who may have different coding styles. Add the ability to identify function calls and use this to work out call-trees (subroutine calls are already captured, although not yet used in any of the output). Add the option for users to specify a Creative Commons license for their documentation, which will be inserted into the page footer. Make it possible to override the display options within a particular part of the code and/or for an individual item within the code. Provide an option to force all (non-string) text which is captured to be lower case. Add the ability to recognize the use of intrinsic modules Add the ability to allow for only statements when loading modules and for renaming module procedures when loading them. Improve the sidebar for source files so that it will link to the items that it lists. Allow the user to provide a favicon. Provide a directory in which the user can place any images and/or other media they want available. Use summaries of the description in some places. Improve the way procedures are handled as arguments. In particular, allow any abstract interface which was used as a template to be visible somehow. Things which ideally I would do, but are not currently on the radar include: Add the ability for people to customize appearance of the output more (this would require drastic changes to the template system). Support fixed-form Fortran (doable, but low priority). Add the ability to identify type-bound procedure calls and use these to construct call-trees. This would be extremely difficult, as it would require keeping track of names and types of variables throughout the code. Approach The basic algorithm for generating the documentation is as follows: Get instructions from user. These are to be passes as command-line arguments and meta-data within the project file. Parse each file which is to be documented. Create a file object. This will contain any documentation meant for the file as a whole and a list of any file contents. Create module, subroutine, function, and/or program objects for each of these structures within the file. Each of these objects will also store comments, contents, and parameters. Continue to recurse into these structures, adding interface, type, variable, subroutine and function objects as necessary. Perform further analysis on the parsed code, correlating anything defined in one place but used in another. This will be used to generate hyperlinks when producing the documentation. Convert comments into HTML . Assume that they have been written in Markdown. Also make sure to process LaTeX (not yet implemented). Produce the documentation. This will be done using Jinja2 templates.","tags":"Python Fortran Programming Software","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/ford-fortran-documentation.html","title":"FORD : FORtran Documentation"},{"text":"Well, it's that time of year again. 95 years and 362 days ago we saw the Armistice that ended World War I. This marked the end of the first case technological war, which caused the world to realize the horrors that could be inflicted by industrial-scale killing. It was a horrible, pointless event in which some 16 million people lost their lives. The world, including the victors, reacted in horror to what they had unleashed. We quickly saw the establishment of Remembrance Day, to commemorate the tragedy, and the red poppy as a symbol of remembrance. Of course, as we all know, this was followed two decades later by another, even worse, case of mass slaughter. I tend to identify as a moderate pacifist. I'm not an absolute pacifist like Gandhi was; I think that violence is justified if it is absolutely necessary for self-defence. I will reluctantly admit that we probably did have to fight in World War II , such was the threat of Hitler. 1 But I do not believe that the First World War was in any way necessary or justifiable. Moreover, I would argue that the Second World War was ultimately the result of how Germany was treated in the Treaty of Versaille and was thus, ultimately, avoidable. As for subsequent wars in which we've been involved: I can't honestly say that I would consider them much (if any) better than World War I. My relative pacifism results in my having rather ambivalent feelings towards Remembrance Day. These are difficult to put into words, but I'm going to try my best here. While I certainly do think that we should remember the tragedy that was the WWI , WWII , the Korean War, the Gulf War, and Afghanistan, I must say that I have my qualms over how this is done. We are told to be grateful to those who made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve our freedom. But to me it feels wrong to feel grateful to people for going off to kill and be killed. Certainly this is the case in the First World War, where I would argue that the Allies weren't even that much more free than Germany; just look at the treatment of Eugene Debs in the United States. But even in WWII , the most that I can say for those who went off for war is that their actions were necessary but unfortunate and tragic. To say that I am grateful for those actions would make it sound like I'm celebrating them, which I emphatically do not want to do. I have been told by one person that we should respect the fact that these soldiers were, rightly or wrongly, willing to give up their lives for their country. But why? We don't celebrate, in and of itself, the fact that people are willing to give up their lives for their convictions. We only celebrate that sort of martyrdom of we happen to agree with the convictions. We don't celebrate suicide bombers, after all. So I'm not willing simply to celebrate that soldiers were brave enough to go off to battle. Even if we justify their actions by saying that they were misled, I still don't think that justifies any feelings of gratitude. Pity, perhaps, but not gratitude. I can't even bring myself to feel respect for that, as doing so feels like it would be to endorse uncritical obedience. I guess what I'm saying is that Remembrance Day asks us to celebrate the sacrifices made by soldiers without ever questioning why those sacrifices were made. It assumes that the wars in which we engaged were just. Worse still, it often becomes a celebration of military history. In Canada in particular, we are told about how the battles at Passchendaele and Vimy Ridge saw the \"birth of a nation.\" Well, the Canada that I would consider to be my country (if that idealized country has ever actually existed) was not born in any battle. It was born in the establishment of trade unions, the development of our shared public infrastructure, the creation of medicare, our rejection of the war in Vietnam and later Iraq, 2 the writing of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I think that most Canadians perceive ourselves as being fairly peaceful, nonviolent people. So why should we consider these battles to be the birth of our nation? Why should a military event be given such an important role in our history when the Armed Forces play such a small role in our culture? But my bigger problem with Remembrance Day is how it relates to the wars that are going on now. There is, of course, a \"support our troops\" message. Now, one could argue that even this is objectionable, as the Armed Forces are basically salaried killers. I'm not going to get into that here. In any case, no matter what my objections may be to the Armed Forces, I'd still like to see the troops come home safely. In fact, to me, the best way that you can support our troops is to demand that they come home. But \"support our troops\" always seems to have a strong subtext of \"support our wars.\" When I was in grade 9, my school attended a \"support our troops\" rally rather than having our own Remembrance Day ceremony. I think this was related to the fact that an alumnus had recently been killed in Afghanistan. We were assured by the principal that this was distinct from supporting our war. Seven years on, I can't remember exactly what was said at the rally. But I do recall it being emphasized how brave and noble the soldiers were being. And I distinctly remember feeling that I had been duped into attending a pro-war event. That, to me, is not an appropriate way to commemorate the ending of World War I. It seems that, rather than being a time to mourn the horrendous loss of life that we see in modern warfare, Remembrance Day has become a time when we are meant to celebrate the sacrifices of soldiers, past and present. Implicit to this celebration is the idea that their violence was justified. Consider \"In Flanders Field.\" I don't think that there is a single Remembrance Day ceremony, anywhere in Canada, where that poem isn't read. But think about the last stanza: Take up our quarrel with the foe: To you from failing hands we throw The torch; be yours to hold it high. If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders fields. It's asking us to continue fighting. Not to realize the folly of war and lay down our arms, but to persist with it. What's more, it was written during World War I, which was a pointless war between imperialist powers. Canadian soldiers had no quarrel with German soldiers and I consider them just as worthy of our remembrance. But I don't recall that ever being mentioned at any of the numerous Remembrance Day ceremonies that I have attended over the years. All of these feelings are the reason why I haven't made it a point to wear a poppy in recent years. To be clear, it's not that I specifically avoid wearing a poppy. It's just that I haven't had one with me in Halifax and haven't made it a point to buy one. I've been thinking for awhile that I should get my hands on a white poppy . It seems that it would more accurately convey my mixed feelings about Remembrance Day. I know that many veterans find it offensive and I regret causing offence. However, if they find the idea of denouncing the violence of the wars they fought in offensive, then they are in the wrong and I would not censor myself for their sake. I guess the point that I'm trying to make is: at 11: 00AM on November the 11 th we should remember everyone who has suffered in war. But I do mean everyone. We should remember the Canadian and American and British soldiers who fell. We should remember those who lived, but with both mental and physical injury. We should remember the German and Austrian and Italian soldiers. And we should remember the civilians who died as armies marched across the world and bombs fell from the skies. We should remember how horrific war was. We should remember why war should never be allowed to happen again. Lest we forget… I do, however, have a lot of respect for the pacifists within the CCF (the more radical predecessor to the NDP ) who argued in parliament against our involvement in World War II . It's certainly a far cry from the NDP 's support, a few years ago, for bombing Libya. ↩ Although both of these were only partial objections. We, unfortunately, did provide support for the Americans—we just never actually engaged in battle. ↩","tags":"Personal Pacifism Remembrance Day Poppies","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/the-rights-and-wrongs-of-remembrance.html","title":"The Rights and Wrongs of Remembrance"},{"text":"Note: I wrote this guide for the Saint Mary's University Astronomy and Physics Society to go along with a tutorial that I will present on the Fortran programming language. I thought I'd post it here in addition to the SMUAPS website . Fortran, which stands for FORmula TRANslator, is the oldest high level programming language and remains, albeit with significant improvements, one of the main languages used by physicists. 1 Most computational physics is done using Fortran and this is the language typically used in SMU 's Computational Methods for Physicists class. This introduction will show you how to use various useful features of the language in its modern form. 2 It will do this by defining a problem which we wish a program to solve and then showing how to write such a program. The program can be downloaded here if you want to follow along (which I'd recommend doing). I assume that you already know how the basics of computer programming but have not previously done scientific computing or worked with Fotran. Of course, this will only be a taste of Fortran's abilities and there will be many features, both simple and complex, which I will not be able to mention.

We now want to calculate the electric field that exists at each point where we took a measurement. These results will be printed to a second text file on the computer. The program should also find the average electric field and the standard deviation. The Numerical Method To do this, we need to recall that $$ \\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V. $$ In our simple, one dimensional case, this becomes $$ E = -\\frac{dV}{dx}. $$ However, we don't actually know the function \\(V(x)\\) , only the value of \\(V\\) at particular values of \\(x\\) . So, how do we calculate the derivative? In reality, we'll have to estimate it. The limit definition of the derivative says $$ \\frac{dV}{dx} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{V(x + h) - V(x)}{h}, $$ so you might be tempted to use $$ \\frac{dV_{i}}{dx} \\approx \\frac{V_{i+1} - V_{i}}{x_{i+1} - x_{i}}. $$ However, that is only accounting for the rate of change on one side of your data-point, \\(i\\) . Thus, it would be better to use $$ \\frac{dV_{i}}{dx} \\approx \\frac{V_{i+1} - V_{i-1}}{x_{i+1} - x_{i-1}}. $$ Of course, this won't work at two ends of the data set, so in those cases we'll simply have to make do with half of the information and use something along the lines of our first guess of how to take the derivative. Statistics As I hope everyone will know, the average value of some data is given by $$ \\overline{x} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}&#94;{N} x_i~. $$ As a reminder, the standard deviation of a data-set is $$ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}&#94;N (x_i - \\overline{x})&#94;2}.$$ The Algorithm The basic structure of our program will be as follows Determine the files from which to read and to which to write data. Read the data from the input file. Take the derivative of the data and multiply by negative one. Write the processed data to the output file. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the processed data. Print these statistical values to the screen. The calculations in steps 3 and 5 are to be done using the techniques and equations discussed in the previous section. A Note on Style Fortran, as a language, is case-insensitive. This means that \" HELLO \", \"hello\", and \"hElLo\" are equivalent. The original standard style for programming in Fortran was to use all upper-case letters. Personally, I find this hard to read. Many people, today, will use entirely lower-case letters, and some will use a mixture of both. I have read that the standard now is to use upper-case letters for anything that is intrinsic to the language, and lower-case letters for everything else. Although it is debatable how many people actually stick to this, I will be using this style throughout this tutorial. Note that case-insensitivity does not apply to the contents of strings. Comments and White-Space From Fortran 90 onward, comments are designated by an exclamation mark. Anything on a line following an exclamation mark (assuming that the exclamation mark isn't inside a string) will be ignored by the compiler. Comments should be used to document your code. I'd recommend having a standard template that you use at the top of each program explaining what it does. An example of the format I use is provided below. !==============================================================================! ! B E G I N P R O G R A M : ! !

EXTERNALS: None ! ! ! !------------------------------------------------------------------------------! The Fortran 90 standard saw the adoption of free-form programming. This means that you can insert any number of blank lines that you like between successive lines of code and that there can be as many spaces as you like within a line of code. Note, however, that most compilers will place a limit on the number of characters that you may have in a line; often this is 132 characters. In any case, it is bad style, in my opinion, to have lines longer than about 80 characters. Fortran Basics Before we fully begin, there are a few more things I want to discuss. These are some of the fundamental concepts seen in every programming language. I'm going to assume that you are familiar with these principles and will just show how they are applied in Fortran. Basic Program Structure The great advantage of Fortran is the fairly obvious meaning of all of its syntax—something which can emphatically not be said for C. The basic structure of our program will be: PROGRAM potential_field IMPLICIT NONE ! Variable declarations ! ... !---------------------------------------! ! Main program ! ... STOP END PROGRAM potential_field The first line says that you are writing a stand-alone program (as opposed to, say, a subroutine) called \"potential_field\". IMPLICIT NONE instructs the compiler to give an error message if it encounters any variables which haven't been declared. This should always be put at the start of programs in order to prevent bugs occurring due to typos in variable names. After this we would declare our variables and then would come the program itself. STOP stops the execution of the program and the final line designates the end of the program within your text file. You are then free to write any procedures you want below that. Unlike many other programming languages, Fortran does not allow anything in your source file to fall outside of a program unit—that is, outside of a program, subroutine, function, or module (more on the latter three later). Variables Fortran has five fundamental data-types: INTEGER s are integer values, which can be represented exactly by the computer. REAL s are floating point numbers, representing real numbers. They are not exact representations of real numbers, having only a finite number of decimal places. COMPLEX variables are effectively just two real variables, one storing the real component of a number, the other storing the imaginary component. These don't need to be used very often. CHARACTER s are text characters, usually encoded as ASCII . Character variables can be given a length, allowing them to be used as strings. LOGICAL s are boolean variables, which can store a value of either .TRUE. or .FALSE. You can also define \"derived types,\" which are the equivalents to structs in C or objects/classes in other languages. These are only really needed in larger programs, where they can provide a useful way of organizing data and code. A sample of the variable declarions in our code are given below. CHARACTER ( LEN = 32 ) :: infile = 'in.dat' , & outfile = 'out.dat' INTEGER , PARAMETER :: data_max = 1012 INTEGER :: i , & ioval , & num_args , & data_size = data_max REAL ( 8 ) :: mean , & stdev REAL ( 8 ), DIMENSION ( data_max ) :: field , & postn , & potntl The ampersands indicate line continuation. CHARACTER(LEN=32) means that these variables are strings containing 32 characters. The PARAMETER attribute means that the variable is a constant, whose value is set at declaration. REAL(8) means that this is an 8-byte real variable (the equivalent of a double in C), which provides about twice the precision of a standard REAL variable. The DIMENSION() attribute indicates that this variable will be an array. The number inside the parentheses is the length of the array. It must either be a literal or a parameter. You can also have multidimensional arrays, which are declared with a DIMENSION(dim1,dim2,dim3,...) attribute. By default, Fortran arrays are indexed starting at 1, unlike most other languages. On a technical note, they are stored in column major order rather than the more typical row major order . Conditional Statements If you want a single line to be executed only if <condition> is true, you would use the following syntax: IF ( < condition > ) < statements > The general form for an if-statement is IF ( < condition > ) THEN < statemtents > ELSE IF ( < condition2 > ) THEN < statemtents > ELSE IF ( < condition3 > ) THEN < statemtents > ELSE < statemtents > END IF There can be an arbitrary number of ELSE IF s, including zero. The ELSE statement is optional, but if it is used then it must come at the end. <condition> is a LOGICAL variable or a logical test. The logical operators in Fortran are == , /= , > , < , >= , <= , .NOT. , .AND. , .OR. , and .XOR. . The meaning of all of these is what you would expect, except possibly for /= , which corresponds to \"not equal to.\" Fortran can not use != because the exclamation mark is the symbol for a comment. Loops The main type of loop which you'll use in Fortran is a \"do-loop,\" the equivalent of a for-loop. This takes the form DO index = lower , upper [, step_size ] < statements > END DO where index is the counter variable in the loop, lower is the lower bound, upper is the upper bound, and step_size is the increment by which to increase the index. The upper and lower bounds are inclusive. There are also while loops, which have the syntax DO WHILE ( < condition > ) < statements > END DO You can exit a loop with the command EXIT , or skip to the next iteration with the command CYCLE . The EXIT command allows us to use the loop structure DO < statements > END DO which would otherwise be an infinite loop. Getting Instructions from the User We need our program to read in data provided by the user. The best way to do this is to read it from a text file. We could simply \"hardcode\" into the program the name of the file in which the data is to be placed. However, it would be preferable if the user were to be able to over-ride this default. The same applies for the file to which we want our results to be written. We could simply ask the user for the file names when the program is running, but this is rather ungainly. A far nicer solution is for the user to, if they desire, specify the file names as command-line arguments. To accomplish this we use the following bit of code: num_args = COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT () IF ( num_args >= 1 ) CALL GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT ( 1 , infile ) IF ( num_args >= 2 ) CALL GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT ( 2 , outfile ) The first line here asks for the number of command-line arguments which have been provided. If any have been then the first will be the file containing the data to be read in and we will place that data in the appropriate string variable ( infile ). If there is also a second argument then it will be the name of the file to which to output the data, and it will also be placed in the appropriate variable ( outfile ). The default input and output file names were assigned when infile and outfile were declared. In this snippet of code there are a few things worth noting. I make use of two intrinsic procedures: the function COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT and the subroutine GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT . I will explain subroutines and functions in more detail soon. These two procedures happen to be part of the Fortran 2008 standard. Most compilers featured equivalent functions prior to the 2008 standard, but there was never any guarantee that they would be the same between compilers. We encounter variable assignment in the first line. This is unremarkable and just like every other high-level programming language. Values are also assigned in second and third line, but to the arguments of a subroutine. More on that in a bit. Reading and Writing Data Now that we know the names of the input and output files, we want to write the code needed to actually perform input and output. If there was one thing that I could change about Fortran, it would be how it does IO ; the technique it uses is old-fashioned and extremely clunky. First, we must open a file. To do this, we use the command OPEN(unit, FILE='<filename>'[, <other options>]) . The unit is an integer, specifying which IO \"stream\" we want to use. There are a few which are reserved: 0 for standard-error, 5 for standard-in, and 6 for standard-out. You should use a positive integer less than 100. Perhaps the most important of the other options which may be used when opening a file is STATUS=\"...\" . The string may be set to \"unknown,\" indicating that we don't know whether or not the file already exists, \"new,\" indicating that the file should not already exist, or \"old,\" indicating that the file should already exist. You may also use the option IOSTAT=variable , where variable should be an integer. If, after the operation has been completed, variable is equal to zero, then it was successful. Otherwise, it indicates that there was an error of some sort. Without specifying an IOSTAT the program would crash on you. To open our input file, we use the code ! Read in data from the input file OPEN ( UNIT = 10 , FILE = infile , IOSTAT = ioval , STATUS = 'old' ) IF ( ioval /= 0 ) THEN ! Make sure file exists WRITE ( 0 , filedne ) TRIM ( infile ) STOP END IF The statements within the if-statement will write an error message and then stop the program if there was some problem opening the file. We see here our first example of actual IO . This is done by the WRITE statement, which is writing a message to standard error. The next argument, filedne is a format string. I won't go into detail about how these work—you can Google it if you're interested. Essentially, all that they do is specify how to format the output of any variables provided. In this case that variable is TRIM(infile) , where TRIM() is a built-in function which strips any trailing spaces from the string. Instead of using a format string, you can just replace the variable name with an asterisk, causing Fortran to automatically format your output for you. This is often sufficient and we will see examples of it below. The general form for output statements is WRITE(<unit>,<format-string>) <variables...> . Here, <variables...> are the variables whose values are to be outputted. Next we'll read in the data. Input statements are very similar to output statements, except that WRITE is replaced with READ . The general form is READ(<unit>,<format-string>) <variables...> . In this case, the input data will be placed into the variables we specify in <variables> . Input is done line-by-line with as many variables filled as possible, given the amount of data on the line. For input you should almost always use an asterisk instead of a format string. An additional argument which can be provided for READ statements is an IOSTAT . This works in exactly the same way as in the OPEN statement and can be useful to know when you've read to the end of a file. DO i = 1 , data_max ! Read until end of file or reach maximum amount of data READ ( 10 , * , IOSTAT = ioval ) postn ( i ), potntl ( i ) IF ( ioval /= 0 ) THEN data_size = i - 1 EXIT END IF IF ( i == data_max ) WRITE ( 6 , * ) 'POTENTIAL_FIELD: Could not read ' // & 'all input data. Truncated after ' , data_max , ' elements.' END DO This bit of code will read in as much data from the file as we have room for in our arrays, storing it in the arrays postn and potntl . If it reaches the end of the file then it will remember the amount of data read in and exit the loop. If it reaches the end of the array then it will print a warning message saying that some of the data may have been truncated. The two slashses that you see in the WRITE statement are the concatenation operator. Now that we're done with the input file, we'll close it using the command CLOSE(<unit>) . In this case we simply add the line CLOSE(10) . After all of this, outputting our results will seem easy. This is done with the following code fragment which will go after the actual calculations in our program ! Send the data to the output file OPEN ( 10 , FILE = outfile , STATUS = 'unknown' ) WRITE ( 10 , * ) '#Position Field Strength' DO i = 1 , data_size WRITE ( 10 , * ) postn ( i ), field ( i ) END DO CLOSE ( 10 ) There is little to remark upon here, except to note that the first line we write to the file is #Position Field Strength This provides a header for the file. Most pieces of plotting software know to ignore lines beginning with a hash-sign. Thus, this provides a way to remind yourself what the data in your file are, without getting in the way if you want to make a graph from it. I consider it to be good style to put such a header at the top of all of your data files. Procedures When writing a program, it is often useful to place some of your code into subprograms. There are two main reasons for this. It allows the code to be executed multiple times without having to be rewritten each time. It allows the code to be reused in future programs. In Fortran we call these \"procedures.\" In most languages they are called \"methods.\" Fortran has two types of procedures: functions and subroutines. Functions produce a value and are akin to the methods that you see in other languages. Subroutines do not produce a value and are similar to void methods in other languages. It is best to place any procedures at the end of your program. Just below where your program ends (after the STOP command) type a line containing only the word CONTAINS . Place your procedures below that and before the end of the program. PROGRAM potential_field IMPLICIT NONE ! Variable declarations ! ... !---------------------------------------! ! Main program ! ... STOP CONTAINS ! Subroutines and functions ! ... END PROGRAM potential_field There is another way to package procedures, using \"modules.\" I'll explain those later. I should also mention that it is possible to place your procedures entirely outside of any program or module and in older versions of Fortran this was the only option. However, unless you need to do this in order to work with some legacy code, this is not a practice that I would recommend. 3 When procedures are stored in this way, the compiler won't be able to check that you have passed the correct number and types of arguments and these bugs are, in my experience, immensely frustrating to catch. Pass by Reference In most programming languages, when you pass a variable to a method as an argument, a new copy of that variable is created for the method to use. This variable will then be deleted once the method has finished executing. This technique is call \"pass by value.\" Fortran, however, works differently. Instead of creating a copy of the passed variable, the procedure will be told where the original variable is located and will then access the original whenever the variable is used. This is called \"pass by reference.\" If you are only using the variable's value as input then this is irrelevant to the end user. However, if you modify the value of an argument in the procedure, then that modification will be reflected in the calling program once the procedure has finished executing. At the end of the day, what this means is that we have a way for procedures to return multiple pieces of information. This also means that whether you use a function or a subroutine is entirely a matter of taste. Typically, I will use a function if I only want to return a single value. They are particularly useful for representing mathematical functions in numerical routines such as root-finders, integrators, ODE solvers, etc. I use a subroutine if I know that I want to return multiple variables. You will see an example of each in the program we are writing today. Functions I wrote a function to calculate derivatives. The basic syntax for such a function is FUNCTION differentiate ( independent , dependent ) IMPLICIT NONE ! Argument declarations REAL ( 8 ), DIMENSION (:), INTENT ( IN ) :: dependent , & independent REAL ( 8 ), DIMENSION (:), ALLOCATABLE :: differentiate ! Local variables ! ... ! Perform the calculation ! ... RETURN END FUNCTION differentiate We see that this function is called differentiate and takes two arguments: independent and dependent . While programs are ended with the keyword STOP , functions (and subroutines) are ended with the keyword RETURN . We call the function with field ( 1 : data_size ) = differentiate ( postn ( 1 : data_size ), potntl ( 1 : data_size )) The (1:data_size) is an example of \"array-slice notation.\" More on that later. Unlike languages based on C, arguments are not declared in the argument list but in the body of the procedure alongside the local variables. You also need to declare the return variable, which, by default, has the same name as the function. When declaring the arguments you should add the attribute INTENT(<value>) where <value> may be IN , OUT , or INOUT . The first instructs the compiler that the value of the argument must not be changed within the procedure, while the second tells the compiler that the variable must have a new value assigned to it within the procedure. The initial value of this argument in the procedure is not guaranteed to be the same as the one it held prior to being passed. The final option basically tells the compiler that there are no such requirements for that argument and is the default case if you omit the INTENT attribute. No INTENT should be given to the return variable, although it is treated as if it were declared with INTENT(OUT) . Something which you may have noticed here is how we declared our input arrays with DIMENSION(:) . This syntax can be used for procedure arguments to indicate that the size of the array is not known in advance. The size will be set to be however large the array passed to the procedure is. A similar notation is used for our return value, but that's because it is an ALLOCATABLE array. More on that in the sidebar below. The full code for this function is provided below. FUNCTION differentiate ( independent , dependent ) IMPLICIT NONE ! Input and output variables REAL ( 8 ), DIMENSION (:), INTENT ( IN ) :: dependent , & independent REAL ( 8 ), DIMENSION (:), ALLOCATABLE :: differentiate ! Local variables INTEGER :: i , & ret_size !--------------------------------------------------------------------------! ! Figure out how much data there is to process ret_size = MIN ( SIZE ( dependent ), SIZE ( independent )) ALLOCATE ( differentiate ( 1 : ret_size )) ! Calculate derivative for first data-point differentiate ( 1 ) = ( dependent ( 2 ) - dependent ( 1 )) / ( independent ( 2 ) - & independent ( 1 )) ! Calculate derivative for data-points in the middle FORALL ( i = 2 :( ret_size - 1 )) differentiate ( i ) = ( dependent ( i + 1 ) - & dependent ( i - 1 )) / ( independent ( i + 1 ) - independent ( i - 1 )) ! Calculate the derivative for the last data-point differentiate ( ret_size ) = ( dependent ( ret_size ) - & dependent ( ret_size - 1 )) / ( independent ( ret_size ) - & independent ( ret_size - 1 )) RETURN END FUNCTION differentiate I should mention that Fortran comes with a number of built-in functions. In particular, it has all of the mathematical functions that you'd expect. We also so the MIN() and SIZE() intrinsic functions. The first returns the smallest value in a list of arguments or in an array. The second returns the number of elements in an array. Sidebar: You may notice that our return-variable here is declared with the attribute ALLOCATABLE . By default, Fortran arrays are static, meaning that they have a fixed length determined at compile-time. However, sometimes you might not know what size you want at compile-time or you might want to adjust the size part way through your program. (Here it is the former.) In that case, you use an allocatable array. When first declared, these arrays have no determined size, although you do have to specify their rank by using colons in the DIMENSION attribute. For example, a 3D array would be declared with DIMENSION(:,:,:) . Once you know they size you want, you allocate them as follows ALLOCATE ( array ( lower : upper )) where lower is the index which you want the array to start at while upper is the index that you want it to end at. These bounds are inclusive. Once you are done with the array, you can deallocate it with DEALLOCATE(array) . You can then reallocate it again (potentially to a different size) if you wish. When a procedure exits, all local allocatable arrays are automatically deallocated. Sidebar 2: Another new feature which I've introduced here is the FORALL construct. This structure is used for array assignment and manipulation. It behaves similarly to a loop, but there are some important differences. From the old array, it will calculate values for the new array and place them in temporary storage. Once it has calculated the value for every element it will place them in the new array. The forall construct may iterate over the array in any order. Its main purpose is to make it easier for the compiler to optimize your code and run it on parallel architectures, but it is also just a convenient way of writing certain expressions. You can learn more here . Subroutines In our programming exercise, I used a subroutine to calculate some statistical information. The basic syntax for such a subroutine is given below. SUBROUTINE stats ( array , mean , stdev ) IMPLICIT NONE ! Argument declarations REAL ( 8 ), DIMENSION (:), INTENT ( IN ) :: array REAL ( 8 ), INTENT ( OUT ) :: mean , & stde ! Local variables ! ... !Perform the calculation !... RETURN END SUBROUTINE stats Other than the fact that you don't need to declare a return value, there isn't much to say about subroutines which wasn't covered in the discussion about functions. The full code for the subroutine is SUBROUTINE stats ( array , mean , stdev ) IMPLICIT NONE ! Input and output variables REAL ( 8 ), DIMENSION (:), INTENT ( IN ) :: array REAL ( 8 ), INTENT ( OUT ) :: mean , & stdev ! Local variables INTEGER :: i , & num REAL ( 8 ) :: running_tot !--------------------------------------------------------------------------! ! Compute the mean num = SIZE ( array ) mean = SUM ( array ) / REAL ( num , 8 ) ! Compute the standard deviation DO i = 1 , num running_tot = running_tot + ( array ( i ) - mean ) ** 2 END DO stdev = SQRT ( 1. d0 / REAL (( num - 1 ), 8 ) * running_tot ) RETURN END SUBROUTINE stats Array Syntax Fortran features powerful array syntax, similar to what is available in Python. The simplest bit of this syntax is if you want an array which, element by element, is the sum of two other arrays of the same size. You simply use the syntax array1 = array2 + array3 . You can use similar syntax for just about any operation on an array, including single-argument operators and operators with scalars: array1 = array2 + scalar . In this case scalar will be treated as though it were an array of the same size as array1 and array2 where every element had the same value as scalar . With the right keywords, you can even apply your own functions and subroutines to arrays in this way. More advanced results can be achieved using array-slice notation. This allows you to work with only a portion of an array. The syntax is array([lower]:[upper][:stride]) . This returns an array containing every stride th element of array starting at lower and ending at upper . By default increment is 1, lower is index at which array starts, and upper is the index at which array ends. Thus, array(:) corresponds to the whole array. The slice syntax can be used in multidimensional arrays too, with any mix you please of array-slices and specific indices in the different directions. For example, if we had a 3D array with 100 elements in each dimension we could specify array3d(:,1:25,50) would give you the a 2D array with dimensions 100 by 25. I used array slices a few times in our program. One example is when the program calculates the electric field: field ( 1 : data_size ) = differentiate ( postn ( 1 : data_size ), potntl ( 1 : data_size )) field ( 1 : data_size ) = - 1.0 * field ( 1 : data_size ) The first line here calculates the derivative of the data in the arrays postn and potntl up to the data_size th element, storing the results in field . The second line multiplies the elements of field containing useful data by -1. These were very simple uses of array-slices and shows only some of their power. Compiling and Running Your Program We now have a working program. As a reminder, you can download it here . It's time to compile it and see if it works! The Fortran compiler which you will use most often is gfortran . This is a decent compiler 4 and has the advantage of being free software. 5 If you are running Linux then you can install it using sudo apt-get install gfortran (assuming it's Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, or one of their derivatives—I don't know how to use other distro's package managers). Otherwise you can download it here . Compiling and running a simple program like this is very easy; just type gfortran ./potential_field.f90 at the command line in the directory where you've kept your source code. This will produce the executable file called a.out . To run the program, type ./a.out . Before running it, make sure that you have a file containing your data on the electrical potential called \"in.dat\". If you use the in.dat file provided here then you should get the following output: The output file out.dat should match this one . You should see an electric field that rounds to 20 NC -1 everywhere. Don't worry if your numbers vary from mine in the last few decimal places. The last decimal places of floating point values often vary from computer to computer and from compiler to compiler because of the finite levels of precision with which floating point numbers can be stored. If your input data is contained in some file other than in.dat then you can run the program using the command ./a.out infile . If you want your output data to go to a file other than out.dat then run the program with the command ./a.out infile outfile . You could also compile your program with the command gfortran -o potential_field potential_field.f90 . This will produce an executable called potential_field . Had a different argument been placed after the -o flag then that would have been the name of the executable. The program would now be run using the command ./potential_field . Once again, you can optionally extra arguments specifying the input and output files. Packaging Your Procedures For a small, simple program like this it is easiest to keep everything in one file. However, as your program becomes larger, it will become desirable to put certain things into separate files. This prevents files from becoming overwhelmingly huge. 6 It also means that if you want to reuse some of your procedures in other programs, it will be a lot easier to transfer them over. If you compile them correctly (not something we'll get into here) then you won't even need to transfer them—you can use the same \"library\" file for multiple programs. In order to retain the compiler's ability to know whether we are passing the correct arguments to a procedure we need to place that procedures in a \"module\". Modules are a bit like programs, containing both variables and procedures (also \"derived types,\" in case you ever want to use them). However, unlike programs, they can not be run on their own; they just contain code to be used by other modules and programs. The basic syntax for our module is MODULE tools IMPLICIT NONE !Variable declarations ! ... CONTAINS ! Procedures ! ... END MODULE tools If your module does not contain any procedures then omit the CONTAINS statement. To make a module's contents available to a program (or another module) you place a USE statement followed by the module name at the very start of your program—before even the IMPLICIT NONE statement. In our case this means that our program starts with PROGRAM potential_field USE tools IMPLICIT NONE ! ... If you need to load multiple modules then you place additional USE statements at the start of the program, each on its own line. Take a look at the module and modified program to see what changes were made. The main disadvantage of using modules (although it's one that can be overcome with sufficient organization and/or appropriate software tools) is that it makes the compile process more complicated. It is important that module files are compiled before any files which use them. This is because, upon compiling the module into an \"object file,\" the compiler will produce a file ending in the extension .mod . This file contains information for the compiler about the contents of the module and which will need to read as it compiles anything that uses the module. Needless to say, if you have modules using other modules then things can get complicated. In this case we can compile like so: gfortran -c tools_mod.f90 gfortran -c potential_field2.f90 gfortran -o potential_field2 tools_mod.o potential_field2.o Aside from the change in the name of the executable, the program can be run just as before. Summing Up There you have it. You've now seen how various features in Fortran work and seen an example of a working program. Although this was a lot of information all at once, Fortran really isn't a hard language to learn. The syntax is intuitive and the modern version comes with enough features to be useful but not so many as be overwhelming. Don't feel bad if you've forgotten some of the syntax that I've gone over—even experienced programmers will occasionally have to look something up. Hopefully now you'll feel ready to try writing a program of your own in Fortran and begin learning the language's capabilities and limitations in the best way possible: through experience. Useful Resources There are plenty of features in Fortran which I have not mentioned. If you want to learn more about them, some useful links are given below: Fortran 95 language features : A Wikipedia article which gives a good overview of the various capabilities of Fortran 95. I regularly use this as a reference when I forget some syntax. Mistakes in Fortran 90 Programs that Might Surprise You : A webpage describing some of the more obscure behaviour of Fortran. It's good to be familiar with what these are. If your program is behaving strangely, these are all good things to check for. Fortran Formats : Some information on how format strings can be used to specify output (and, in principle, input) in Fortran. The GNU Fortran Compiler : The manual for gfortran, the main free compiler. In my opinion it is the best documented compiler out there. Particularly useful is its list of intrinsic functions and subroutines, which comes with information and, usually, an example for each one. The New Features of Fortran 2003 : A PDF providing an introduction to what's new in the Fortran 2003 standard. Note that not all features are yet supported by all compilers. The New Features of Fortran 2008 : A PDF providing an introduction to what's new in the Fortran 2008 standard. Note that not all features are yet supported by all compilers. Others including C and C++, when high efficiency is desired, and MATLAB and Python for data processing. ↩ For the most part we'll be sticking to the 1995 standard. The 2003 and 2008 standards, which contain many powerful new features such as object-oriented programming, are still not entirely supported by compilers. You can see their current statuses here and here . That said, enough has been implemented that you can now write object-oriented code in Fortran if you are using a relatively up-to-date compiler. ↩ Even when working with legacy code, you can often use what's called an interface to manually tell the compiler what arguments are required. While these are a bit tedious to write, and thus shouldn't be used with new code, they are worth your while if you can't package your procedures in a more modern way. ↩ However, for actual computational physics, you will likely end up using ifort or pgfortran , which produce faster programs. Their major disadvantage is that the licenses are extremely expensive. They are also proprietary software. ↩ That's free as in \"free beer\" and free as in \"free speech\". Another way to say this is that GFortran is open source. However, some—including the GNU Project, which makes GFortran—object to that term and think \"free software\" is better. It's one of those People's Front of Judea vs. Judean People's Front sort of things. ↩ I know of one case where the developer refuses to split up the code, resulting in a file that is about 130 thousand lines long. It is not my favourite file to have to deal with. ↩ if (!document.getElementById('mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#')) { var align = \"center\", indent = \"0em\", linebreak = \"false\"; if (false) { align = (screen.width < 768) ? \"left\" : align; indent = (screen.width < 768) ? \"0em\" : indent; linebreak = (screen.width < 768) ?

It appears that it is not uncommon for pharmaceutical companies (I'm going to avoid the term \"Big Pharma\" here, as to me it always sound like a juvenile attempt at fear-mongering) to suddenly stop, or at least drastically scale down, production of frequently used drugs. Unfortunately, no real solutions were being offered to this. At most, Health Canada was trying to make it mandatory for the manufacturers to report shortages. This is by no means the only problem that exists with pharmaceutical companies. I vaguely remember hearing several years ago on an American news channel that many companies were no longer producing generics, as they are not very profitable. Of course, generics are a lot cheaper for consumers, as they are not subject to the legal monopoly of patent law. Patents themselves are problematic as they increase prices, but some form of patent protection seems to be needed in order to encourage innovation and the development of new drugs by the private sector. But even patents aren't always enough to encourage the research we need. This became clear in a recent report by CBC that pharmaceutical companies do not seem to be interested in developing new antibiotics . The reason for this is that this is quite a research-intensive process with relatively low returns, as antibiotics aren't used that much compared to medication for chronic conditions. However, it is absolutely vital that new antibiotics are developed as old ones are becoming ineffective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The problem is becoming so acute that even New Scientist , a liberal but hardly a socialist publication, published an editorial calling for all pharmaceutical companies to be converted non-profit bodies charged with pursuing the public interest. 1 Whether this meant nationalization or simply conversion to independent non-profit organizations (or some mixture of the two) I am not sure. In any case, I strongly support such a demand and think that it would be enormously beneficial. Those who know me well won't be surprised by this, as it seems that my response to just about any problem that I see in the economy is to nationalize the relevant sector. 2 However, in this case I am perfectly willing to call for a more pragmatic solution—at least for the time being. Given how important a steady supply of drugs is to the healthcare system, you don't want to do anything that could seriously disrupt their production. Also, this is a problem which really does need to be fixed as soon as possible and, while the nationalization of a whole sector would never win broad support in the near future, 3 a more moderate idea might. Not to say that this idea isn't radical given the current political climate, but it is something which could be justified based on pragmatism and could still seem at least vaguely conceivable to the general public. My proposal is fairly simple: the creation of a new Crown Corporation. 4 Since most people my age won't know what this is (it having been so long since any new ones have been created) I'll explain: a Crown Corporation is a companies which, rather than being owned by private individuals or listed on the stock market, is owned by the government. The only significant example in Nova Scotia is NSLC (the liquor stores). In most of Canada (although not Nova Scotia) the power companies are owned by the provincial government. Federal Crown Corporations include Canada Post, CBC , and Via Rail. We used to own a lot more too: NS Power, Air Canada, the Uranium mines, Canadian National Railway, and Petro-Canada, among others. However, these were sold off in the ‘80s and ‘90s, purportedly to improve the efficiency of these companies although I'm inclined to think that it was primarily for ideological reasons. Anyway, back to my point. I think that the government should create a new Crown Corporation which, for the sake of argument, I shall call Pharmacy Canada. Pharmacy Canada would be charged with the development of new drugs which would tend to have a low rate of return on investment (such as antibiotics) as well as producing generic drugs. These would be sold at cost to the provincial health authorities. They could also be sold slightly above cost to other developed countries and, perhaps, at a subsidized rate to developing countries. An additional role that could be played by Pharmacy Canada would be to act as a bulk-purchaser of those drugs which still needed to be obtained from the private sector. These would then be sold on, at cost, to the provinces as well. The advantage of such centralized purchasing that it would place Pharmacy Canada in a position to negotiate lower prices. This is a system which has been used successfully by charities to deliver cheaper drugs to developing countries and is, in fact, called for by the Green Party (although no doubt they would balk at the idea of actually producing drugs in the public sector). All of these policies would help to reduce the price of drugs, stabilizing the fastest growing component of healthcare costs and making our public healthcare system more sustainable. This is all eminently achievable even within the current political situation. While it would, no doubt, be heavily lobbied against by the pharmaceutical companies, I don't see what they could actually do to prevent it. I suppose they could retaliate through capital flight, although I don't see how this would be in their interest. If they were to try then their old factories could be bought up by Pharmacy Canada, thus protecting jobs. While setting up a new Crown Corporation would require some capital, interest rates remain low and the federal government has a high credit rating, allowing it to borrow cheaply. The federal deficit is almost gone and we could be running a substantial surplus if we were to return taxes to their 2000 levels. Thus I don't think that there is any real financial argument against establishing Pharmacy Canada. The primary objection to this would be ideological: the belief that the government is not capable of running a successful, productive, company. Such attitudes are wide-spread, even among liberals and social democrats (e.g. the NDP ). While there have been some issues with Crown Corporations in the past, I still think that they were much better run than people give them credit for. They may not have had the profit margins of private enterprise, but this is because they were meant to be meeting social, not just purely economic objectives. Objecting to this (as is done by my father) is to miss the entire purpose of a Crown Corporation; if you wanted it to be run just like a private company then you'd have left it in the private sector in the first place. Although Pharmacy Canada wouldn't deliver the same profit margins as the existing private pharmaceutical companies, it would be able to perform functions which they are failing to do. This sort of value can not be reflected in simple calculations of efficiency. While I suspect that the traditional means of running Crown Corporations 5 would be able to achieve much of what I describe, I believe that even greater accomplishments could be made if Pharmacy Canada were to be run along socialist lines. This would mean that the board would consist of representatives of researchers, doctors, employees, patients, and government. The advantages to this are twofold. First, and more abstractly, it would ensure that the company was run democratically, something which I think has value in its own right. But second, the representation of researchers and doctors would ensure that fruitful avenues of research were being pursued. My strong suspicion is that this would prove a mores successful (as measured in health outcomes, rather than profit) way of directing research than what is currently provided by the private sector. Now, being the realist/cynic that I am, I realize that the creation of Pharmacy Canada stands absolutely no chance of happening even if the NDP were elected in 2015. The idea of public enterprise has simply crept too far outside of the political mainstream. But this is no reason to stop talking about it; if it is ever to get back into the political mainstream then it is something which must become broadly popular and also seriously discussed in progressive political circles. We need organizations like The Broadbent Institute , the Council of Canadians , and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives not only to call for such a policy but to perform studies detailing how to do it. Nor should we be afraid to suggest it as individuals. Because, at least in this case, the radical is becoming the pragmatic. Unfortunately, this article would now be archived and only accessible to those with a subscription, so I can't post a link. ↩ I do realize that this alone won't fix all of the problems, as democratic control is needed over public enterprise if it is to truly behave differently than private enterprise (other than just behaving slightly more bureaucratically). Nonetheless, nationalization is usually a good start in my view, as it begins to address the questions of ownership, control, and power. ↩ In a few countries, there are a few sectors which may prove an exception to this. For example, the rail and energy sectors in Britain or the financial sector in Greece. ↩ For those who are unaware, in Canada \"the Crown\" tends to refer to \"the state\". ↩ Boards of directors were appointed by Parliament, consisting mainly of businessmen (and I use the gendered term deliberately) and former politicians. ↩","tags":"Pharmaceuticals Antibiotics Crown Corporations Socialism","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/fixing-pharmaceuticals.html","title":"Fixing Pharmaceuticals"},{"text":"This was slightly edited in December 2017 to reflect a slightly more sophisticated approach to politics and, well, changes in my facial hair. As you might have gathered from my blog posts here, I am pretty left wing. You know you're pretty radical when you have to preface any explanation of your beliefs with \"Well, I would not consider myself a communist.\" And, while I am quite confidant in the validity of my beliefs, there are days when I really wish that I didn't have them. So, without further ado, here are the top 10 reasons I wish I wasn't a socialist. 1. The exhaustion of trying to stick to the moral high-ground. No one would ever be a socialist in the West if they didn't believe that there was a moral force behind it, backed up by a material analysis of society. Not only does socialism mean that you end up fighting a thankless, apparently losing battle, but also that you're trying to live by a set of principles that can seem impossible under our current system. For example, how am I supposed to find clothes that I know weren't made in sweatshops? How do you live an environmentally-friendly lifestyle in cities designed around the car? How do you fight patriarchy when even your friends sometimes say derogatory things about women? On the more abstract level, it's exhausting trying to explain all of this to friends. And what do you do about that slight feeling of disapproval when they don't live up to your moral standards? Judging people is not only unpleasant, but also quite tiresome as well. 2. I am perpetually angry. Sticking to your moral principles also tends to make you distinctly unhappy about the state of the world around you. Seeing as socialism has been suffering almost nothing but defeats for the past 30 years, just about anything that happens in politics will be bad news for me. I swear, government policy seems almost specifically tailored to piss me off, whether it's cuts in services, cuts in taxes, support for foreign interventions, failure to tackle climate change, rolling back of labour rights, privatization, or what. The wonderfully pessimistic left-wing British comedian Jeremy Hardy sums it up well: All socialists have bad backs because we slouch—except when we're watching the news when we sit on the edge of our seats, shout, and wave our arms. Generally we sit hunched, arms crossed in a judgemental way, the whole of our bodies pulled into a frown. 3. I get to listen to people's ignorant statements about socialism. Because of the horrors inflicted in Eastern Europe in the name of socialism, various people will insist that socialism is an inherently bloody and evil philosophy or that when I advocate something like redistributive taxes (let alone start talking about the long list of industries that I'd like to see nationalized) I am advocating gulags. 1 No less irritating are people who say that socialism inevitably leads to a situation like the one in Greece. Don't these people realize that Greece is an example of a welfare state (albeit a highly dysfunctional one), not a socialist economy in which the means of production are held in common? 4. Having to hold back when discussing politics. Well, as those who know me well can attest, I'm not actually very good at this. But there are many situations in which I do try because, if I were to say what I actually thought, people would think that I was crazy. When I do fully speak my mind, at least to someone who is also political, I will often end up in arguments. Which is never a fun thing and tends to leave me feeling perturbed for a day or two. 5. Looking at the world in a fundamentally different way than others. One of the things which makes political discussions so difficult for me is that the set of assumptions I go in with are different from those of just about everyone else. Of course, the main one is that I don't assume that capitalism is the only option out there. This means that the range of policies I consider are not as constrained as for most people. For example, if someone argues that we can't pursue some regulation because it would cause investment to dry up, then I'd suggest nationalizing the banks so that there is public control over investment. If a policy has the risk of causing a business to leave the country, then place the business under worker's control. But there are also more subtle things at play here. Socialists often have a different interpretation of history than the conventional one. While I think that this is a more accurate interpretation and provides a much better explanation of the world, it does make discussing history with other people more difficult because there is less common ground between us. 6. The difficulty introduced when trying to date. Of course, none of this makes meeting people any easier. It can make things awkward enough among friends. But when you're trying to date it makes things harder still. Politics, after all, are not make a great thing to discuss on a date, especially when your politics are rather unusual. But there's also the fact that if I'm in a relationship I'd like it to be with someone who broadly shares the same values that I do. I don't think this is unreasonable, surely? The problem is, most people are either apolitical (in which case one of my major interests is off the table to talk about) or have considerably more moderate views than mine. Oh well, probably someday I'll meet a nice liberal or social democrat who can put up with my radicalism. Because that seems considerably more likely than my finding another socialist that I'd get along with well enough to want to date. 2 Which leads on to my next point… 7. Having to put up with other socialists. Well, there's a whole article's worth of stuff I could say about this one. There's the fact that most socialists seem to end up taking irrational views on things like nuclear energy, genetically modified foods, and any number of other topics. Similarly, there's the general lack of knowledge about science and critical thinking, the consequent inability to come to informed conclusions, and the stupidity that results when dealing with many contemporary issues (although, in fairness, I think that most ideological groups are guilty of this). There's the sectarianism which means that, in many countries, you have nearly as many socialist parties as there are socialists. And finally there is the bohemian weirdness and alternative lifestyle BS that seems so pervasive. You know what? I don't particularly want to live in a commune! I admit that I'm sexually repressed and I don't have a problem with that! I'm happy being constrained to a monogamistic paradigm within relationships! I don't think that marriage is has to be inherently patriarchal and, yes, I would even like to get married myself some day! I don't feel the need to take mind-altering drugs, smoke pot, dye my hair a funny colour, grow a scraggly beard, eschew going to the barber's shop, get piercings, or have sex with anyone I find remotely attractive! I know that not all socialists correspond to the straw-man that I've constructed, but enough of them do for me to find it off-putting. I guess my feelings can be summed up quite well by something that Orwell 3 wrote in The Road to Wigan Pier : In addition to this there is the horrible—the really disquieting—prevalence of cranks wherever Socialists are gathered together. One sometimes gets the impression that the mere words \"Socialism\" and \"Communism\" draw towards them with magnetic force every fruit-juice drinker, nudist, sandal-wearer, sex-maniac, … [and] \"Nature Cure\" quack … in England. 8. Feeling faintly embarrassed of my beliefs. Because there are so many socialists that display the (in my mind) disreputable qualities listed above, I find myself feeling embarrassed to be associated with them. How can socialism ever be taken seriously if these are the sorts of people representing it? Once again, I think Orwell says it best when he wrote that \"As with the Christian religion, the worst advertisement for Socialism is its adherents.\" 9. Not being politically \"out\" to my family. Nowhere is this embarrassment more apparent than when it comes to my family. I'd never feel comfortable showing them the sort of people and writings produced by many in the socialist movement. And this certainly isn't helped by the fact that my family is a good deal more conservative than me. 4 My parents are essentially small-l liberals. On the one hand they support regulation and things like universal health care, but on the other they certainly wouldn't be in favour of the sorts of nationalizations that I call for and they are vehemently anti-union. What's more, my dad is a business owner. These are hardly people that I can talk to about the ills of capitalism. So I'm never entirely honest with them when it comes to politics and I end up hiding this part of myself from them. 10. Always being on the losing side. As I've stated above, the last thirty years have seen little but defeat for socialist ideas. One only needs to look at the recent Ontario election to see how far to the right things have shifted: the Conservatives were advocating massive tax cuts and the laying-off of 100 thousand public-sector workers, yet they were taken seriously! Meanwhile, the NDP was essentially campaigning on anti-tax policies! How does the Left even begin to fight when even our more moderate ideas, like tax-and-spend policies, seem so alien to the electorate? How do we keep going when we are shunned by the NDP , ignored by the Liberals, and taunted by the Conservatives? How do you keep fighting when every left-wing government seems to end up giving in, at least partially, to capitalism? How do you retain hope as things seem to get inexorably worse? 5 I don't have the answers to all of that. But I still feel that humanity must be capable of something better than what we have right now. If no one fights for that then it definitely won't happen. If we do fight, then at least we stand a chance. For my rebuttal to this, see my earlier post, On Socialists and Scotsmen . ↩ Not to say it's impossible.

This is, in principle, the legislative body of the European Union, although in practice it is debatable how much power it actually holds. For this reason, European elections don't usually attract too much attention, even in Europe, and tend to have turnouts similar to those in municipal elections. Alex Tsipras campaigning for the Party of the European Left. However, as an international observer, what is quite interesting about the European Parliament ( EP ) is the shear diversity of parties represented in it. Compared to the recent Nova Scotian election, where there was so much homogeneity that you would be hard-pressed to tell which party anyone belonged to, the EP elections overwhelm you with choice. But, before I go into what the various choices are, I'll just provide a bit of background on how the EP works. Every country is given a certain number of seats in the EP , distributed according to population. 1 Exactly how Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are elected is left up to the individual countries, the only requirement being that some form of proportional representation is used. In each country, the various national parties will put forward candidates, some of whom will be elected. Most of the national parties will also hold an affiliation to a European party. Elected MEPs sit in groups with their national party, which in turn sits in a group with similar parties from other countries, roughly along the lines of the various European parties. Because these groups consist of a collection of national parties, they won't necessarily have a single, coherent position—a national party will often vote differently from its group. Additionally, the Europarties play little roll outside of the EP ; national parties campaign individually on their own set of policies. Of course, this all seems unnecessarily complicated and confusing, but there you are. As best as I can tell, the reason for this complexity is that the EU never really arose out of a plan but was more stitched together bit by bit. The groups within the EP are (with the main Europarty composing them given in parentheses, if more than one): European People's Party : Pro- EU (support tighter integration), conservative. Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats are notable members. Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats : Pro-Europe, social democracy (centre-left). While consisting of the Party of European Socialists, in reality they are not that different from the European People's Party when it comes to economics. Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group : Pro- EU , centrist, socially liberal, free-market economics. The Greens—European Free Alliance (European Green Party): Green politics, and representatives of nations without states (ex: Scotland, Wales, Catalonia). Economically progressive in principle, but been known to give in to conservatism. European Conservatives and Reformists (Movement for European Reform): Conservative, anti- EU . The British Conservatives are part of this party, but not many other members. European United Left—Nordic Green Left (Party of the European Left): Socialists and communists. Supportive of European integration but don't like the current setup of the EU . Europe of Freedom and Democracy (Movement for a Europe of Liberties and Democracy): Anti- EU , highly conservative, right-wing populist. Tend to be very anti-immigrant and, in particular, anti-Muslim. Similarities to the Tea Party. Independents This list is given in descending order of the size of the EP groups. What is interesting about this election, in particular, is that the more radical parties are expected to do well; the European Left and Europe of Freedom and Democracy are both hoping to make gains. The latter has proven especially good at tapping into discontent and anti-politics sentiment, often presenting themselves as a real alternative to the now indistinguishable main-stream parties. I suppose this is, strictly speaking, true as the main-stream parties tend to be pro- EU and in agreement over centre-right economics. However, it is disingenuous in the extreme for them to portray themselves as representing ordinary people; for example, one of the most notable constituent national parties, the United Kingdom Independence Party ( UKIP ), is led by wealthy financier and arch- Thatcherite Nigel Farage . Yet, since he drinks, smokes, and is more plain-speaking than leaders of the larger parties, he somehow comes off as a man of the people. This has, at times, bizarre results. For example, a poll showed that an overwhelming majority of UKIP voters support renationalization of rail and energy companies. The only party whose voters supported these policies in higher numbers was Labour (unsurprising, given its socialist origins). Yet UKIP has a radical \"small government\" policy, more extreme even than the Conservatives'. 2 All in all, it seems that it is social policy that UKIP and Europe of Freedom and Democracy attract people with. Sad to say, many working class people with progressive economics are distinctly xenophobic. Far more encouraging is the growth of the European United Left—Nordic Green Left ( EUL / NGL ). The national parties in this group are, to a greater or lesser degree, socialists. They are all vehemently opposed to neoliberalism , 3 and most are (at least officially) opposed to capitalism itself. Policies vary from stronger regulation and increased public spending, to (re)nationalisation of banks and energy companies (which seems to be the standard position of group members), to outright revolutionary (although not necessarily insurrectionary 4 ) socialism. Additionally, they call for making the structures of the EU much more democratic. As you might have gathered, the EU is a rather ungainly institution. There are three governing bodies, only one of which (the EP ) is directly elected. EUL / NGL supports giving more power to the EP in order to help remedy this. In addition, the European Central Bank ( ECB , in charge of the Euro's monetary policy) is not under any sort of democratic control. This, in particular, is something that EUL / NGL wishes to change, with the EP appointing the Banks governors and setting its mandate (as is done with most central banks, including the Bank of Canada). They have good reason for this, as the ECB 's current policies have exacerbated the crises in Italy, Greece, et al. (\"the periphery\"). It is resolving these crises that makes up the centrepiece of EUL / NGL policies. The intention is to implement an industrial and redistributive policy which will eliminate the imbalances between \"the centre\" (Germany, France, etc.) and the periphery. While these proposals are really social democratic, rather than anti-capitalist, they would nonetheless be of great help and would likely make it easier for national governments to implement more radical policy. However, there is some debate over how committed to European integration the Left should be. Some feel that, because neoliberalism has more or less been written into the very structure of the EU , the Left should be Eurosceptical. However, as described above, the general position is that the Left should reform the EU . There appear to be two main reasons to pursue this policy. One is an objection to nationalism, which caused so much carnage in the first half of the 20 th century. It was to prevent something like this from ever happening again that European integration was originally begun. The second reason is that it is felt you would need to be coming to power on a continental scale if you seriously want to confront, let alone do away with, capitalism. Otherwise any country attempting the transition to socialism would end up isolated as capitalist nations began committing economic warfare (as happened to Chile in the late ‘60s). Both of the above arguments are strong. However, the issues arises of what will happen if a Left government comes to power in one country much sooner than the others. This is not just idle speculation, as there is a very good chance that EUL / NGL member SYRIZA will come to power in Greece in their next election. 5 SYRIZA has campaigned around ending the austerity in Greece, which is causing massive damage to their economy and creating a humanitarian crisis. However, doing so would involve renegotiating bailout terms with the EU . But, SYRIZA is also determined to stay in the EU and to keep Greece on the Euro. It is unclear that the EU would allow them to do both of these things. Undoubtedly, it would be difficult for Greece to leave the Euro and it would also be extremely unpopular for them to pull out of the EU . From my knowledge, it appears that SYRIZA will only go as far as the EU lets them. Hopefully, this will be far enough to resolve the Greek crisis (kicking out Greece would likely be damaging to Europe as well), but that might not be the case. For what it's worth, my personal view is that Greece shouldn't pull out on its own but if, in the course of implementing SYRIZA 's policies, they get kicked out then so be it. Another interesting case study (if only because all of the debates here are in English) is the formation of the new Left Unity party in the UK . This party is actually fairly radical compared to some of its Continental counterparts, calling for a much greater degree of nationalization (although I suppose that Britain has a history of more extensive public ownership than most countries, so perhaps that isn't surprising). The issue here is that EU regulations would make it vary difficult for Left Unity to implement many of its policies if elected. However, the reasons for staying in the EU that I mentioned above are just as true for Britain as anywhere else and, as a result, Left Unity has much the same set of policies regarding the EU . In this case, I think the answer is much more clean-cut. The radical left in Britain is lagging far behind the rest of Europe, 6 so it is unlikely that the UK would have a Left government before the EU as a whole. Therefore, they might as well advocate staying in the EU and take the same position as the rest of the European Left. Yes, I think that, with the possible exception of countries like Greece, the Left should be trying the achieve socialism at the European level. Various think-tanks, such the Rosa-Luxemburg Siftung (associated with the German party Die Linke ) and transform! (loosely associated with the Party of the European Left ) have called for the ultimate establishment of the United Socialist States of Europe. This, I think, is an admirable goal. However, I am not convinced that this goal can be achieved with the current European leftist institutions. UEL / NGL and the Party of the European Left are both much too loose as associations. To the extent that they coordinate trans-European campaigns at all, they tend to be centred around policies making up the least radical common denominator of their members. For the most part, as with all of the Europarties, active campaigning is left to the individual national members. However, as is generally acknowledged, building socialism requires a Europe-wide movement. That means a truly Europe-wide party. Ultimately, I feel, to be successful, the members of the Party of the European Left will have to give up their individual identities. They'll have to become national chapters of a continent-wide party. And, do you know what? I'm actually somewhat hopeful. For all the mess that the world is in and all the ways that mess is likely to get worse, I can't help but feel that we'll pull through it. It won't be easy, but the worthwhile things seldom are. To the extent that I have faith in anything, I have faith that humanity is capable of being better than it is today. I think Europe can do it—it can overcome the more unpleasant parts of human nature and build a society based on cooperation and solidarity. And if Europe can do it, then so can others. Maybe one day, before I die, I'll wake up in a socialist Cooperative Commonwealth of Canada .

Personally, I'm not convinced that they've actually moved anywhere and think that any perception that they have is simply revealing what was always present in their ideology. For a good discussion of these issues, I recommend this lecture: Syriza and the European Elections . ↩ The reasons for this are complicated, but they seem to include the fact that Britain lacks proportional representation and that the British Left is so notoriously fractious. It's pretty bad when the Wikipedia's list of British political parties needs a whole section just for the Far-Left. ↩","tags":"Europe Socialism Party of the European Left Elections SYRIZA Left Unity","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/on-europe-the-left-and-the-future.html","title":"On Europe, the Left, and the Future"},{"text":"Anyone who knows me in person and has seen me do any amount of work in physics knows that my preferred graphing software is Gnuplot. 1 This is a piece of command-line plotting software capable of producing nearly every sort of graph imaginable. In fact, it's results have appeared on this blog before, and can be found in my perfectly reasonable and not at all neurotic rant about exponential growth. It is capable of plotting data and functions in any number of ways. Most importantly, in my mind, Gnuplot scripts can be written which make it easy to produce many similar plots (batch processing). The only place where I've every really had a problem with Gnuplot is when it comes to including special characters and math in axis labels. Most frustrating of all, if you are an astronomer, is the near impossibility of getting Gnuplot to produce the little symbol used for the sun ( \\(\\odot\\) ). All of this forces scientists to go to great length in order to make the labels on their plots look vaguely decent. This is opposed to some other graphing programs, such as Veusz , which are capable of using parts of the well-known \\(\\LaTeX\\) markup language to produce this sort of output. Thus, a label such as \\(4\\pi r&#94;{2}~\\[R_{\\odot}\\]\\) can be produced with syntax as simple as 4\\pi r&#94;{2}~[M_{\\odot}] . While one of the formats that Gnuplot can output is LaTeX, the quality of the resulting plot is terrible. Just look at the figure below (a plot of some data and curves fit to that data from a recent lab report). LaTeX Gnuplot terminal in all of its ugly glory. However, there is another choice of output: the cairolatex terminal. This terminal, which is related to the pdfcairo terminal, actually produces two files. One of these is a PDF or EPS file with the axes, data, and functions of the plot. The other is a LaTeX file which contains the information necessary to place labels on said plot. The actual plot in this case is of far better quality, while labels are still in LaTeX and can thus contain math, special characters, etc. Producing the same plot as above using this terminal, we get a much better result. cairolatex Gnuplot terminal. The main disadvantage of this approach is that the LaTeX file must be compiled before you can see the actual result. However, with the right settings and a call to a LaTeX compiler at the end of your script, this problem is easily surmountable. In order to make this easy, I've written myself a little template Gnuplot script, with these features built in. Simply change the name of the output file (without including any extension) on line nine and add the various setting and plot commands that you need. Interestingly (or not), despite it's name, Gnuplot has no affiliation with the GNU project whatsoever. It is actually released under a more restrictive license than the GNU GPL . ↩ if (!document.getElementById('mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#')) { var align = \"center\", indent = \"0em\", linebreak = \"false\"; if (false) { align = (screen.width < 768) ? \"left\" : align; indent = (screen.width < 768) ? \"0em\" : indent; linebreak = (screen.width < 768) ?

To this most socialists will respond in one of two ways. Some (mostly those from the Third International , but also a few radical elements of the Second International ) act as apologists for the old Eastern European regimes (and possibly those in Asia as well, although the Sino-Soviet split complicates matters there). Others, such as myself, respond by saying that we don't see how socialism can have failed when the world has yet to see a socialist society. This tends to be the view of Trotskyist (such as those in one the various iterations of the Fourth International ), libertarian socialists, and the more ideologically self-consistent democratic socialists. An example of such an argument is provided in the video below: The inevitable objection that is given, not only by the right but also by the centre-left, is that this is an example of the \"No True Scotsman Fallacy.\" Wikipedia describes this like so: No true Scotsman is an informal fallacy, an ad hoc attempt to retain an unreasoned assertion. When faced with a counterexample to a universal claim (\"no Scotsman would do such a thing\"), rather than denying the counterexample or rejecting the original universal claim, this fallacy modifies the subject of the assertion to exclude the specific case or others like it by rhetoric, without reference to any specific objective rule (\"no true Scotsman would do such a thing\"). Thus, supposedly, it is logically invalid to explain away any unpleasantness by dismissing the regime responsible as not really socialist. Doing so is to dismiss counterarguments without actually addressing it. However, here I feel that there is a misunderstanding of my point. These people misunderstand my argument to be \"socialist societies will inevitably be democratic ones.\" However, for me, such a statement would be a tautology: what I mean when I speak of socialism is \"collective ownership of and democratic control over the economy.\" For me ( and others ), democracy is part of the definition of socialism. Any regime that claims to be socialistic but is a dictatorship (I'm looking at you, Cuba) is lying, at least by my definition of socialism. True, such a regime might claim to be socialism, but that doesn't make it so; just because East Germany was called the German Democratic Republic didn't make it a democracy, after all. Now, some will claim that socialism will never be implemented democratically because people won't want it. Thus, socialism will inevitably have to be imposed using violence and oppression. The first part of this argument is a perfectly valid position to take, although not one that I think is true (actually, there is some historical evidence to the contrary, so anyone making this argument will have to be very careful not to end up using the \"No True Scotsman Fallacy\" themselves). However, in my view, the second part of this argument is meaninglessness. If it is being imposed by a dictatorship then it can not be socialism. Effectively what is being said, then, is that socialism is impossible. This is also a perfectly valid position, but I don't think that there is clear evidence one way or the other with regards to this question. To be sure, horrible things have been done in the name of socialism, and even quite recently the likes of Hugo Chavez have done some rather slimy things in the name of socialism. This potential is something which socialists must constantly be vigilant of. We must accept the ugly parts of our movement's history (and, for that matter, its present). Failure to do so is not only dishonest, but dangerous. However, these dangers do not discredit socialism itself, but rather some (and, thankfully, an ever decreasing number) of the social ists . What's more, I honestly believe that any risk of totalitarianism posed by campaigning for democratic socialism is far smaller than the risks that humanity face under capitalism. As for claims that socialism results in poverty: we have no data, seeing as there have been no socialist economies (at least, not that have lasted for any significant amount of time before being crushed by external forces). I don't think that this will necessarily be the case, but that's only a guess. There's no doubt that there were serious problems with the Warsaw Pact economies. We have to seriously consider whether centralized planning can ever be made to work (personally, I think that it would be undesirable even if it could be done). Certainly, the planning techniques used by the Soviet Union have been discredited. But I hope, and honestly believe, that in a technological, democratic society some form of decentralized economic planning will be possible. Even if not, there are ideas such as cooperative ownership in a market socialist economy, which seem to me to be eminently feasible, if unambitious. So, no, I am not committing the \"No True Scotsman Fallacy\" when I say that the so-called communist countries were not, in fact, socialist. It is not a contradiction for me to be a socialist and yet to oppose Soviet-style communism. It just so happens that there are multiple definitions of socialism and the definition which applies to me (and many others) is directly opposed to that used by the Soviet Union and its supporters.","tags":"Socialism No True Scotsmen Fallacy Noam Chomsky Democracy","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/on-socialists-and-scotsmen.html","title":"On Socialists and Scotsmen"},{"text":"As you may know, Canada Post recently announced that they will be making some changes. Two in particular are of note: a price increase on stamps and the phasing out of door-to-door delivery in urban areas. The latter measure will allow the elimination of about 8000 jobs. However, thanks to the strength of the postal workers' union, no one will actually be fired; rather, the workforce reductions will be achieved by attrition. Community mailboxes, of the sort I've grown up with. Predictably, the left has had a conniption over all of this. A typical example can be found here . In particular, they have denounced the elimination of door-to-door delivery. Given my politics, you may be expecting a similar reaction here. But there you would be wrong. Many parts of Canada already use the community mailboxes which will become the norm over the next few years. It so happens that I grew up in one such area. It was a daily routine to either walk and get the mail or to swing by the mailbox when we were driving somewhere. In the case of the latter, the community mailbox arrangement took at most an extra two minutes out of our day. In the case of the former, it forced us to get a bit of fresh air and exercise. Contrary to what many claim, the scheme is not particularly inconvenient* and certainly is not going to cause the destruction of Canada Post. Actually, if anything the opposite is true. Sometimes people will talk about ending Canada Post's monopoly and introducing competition into mail delivery. I tend to be suspicious of such proposals, but if the proper regulations were in place then I find it hard to actually justify the government monopoly on door-to-door daily mail delivery. Community mail boxes, however, make this much more difficult in my opinion. Do we really want to allow every upstart mail-delivery company to have the keys to everyone's mailboxes? I think that would be rather hard to justify (especially given that the mailboxes are government property) and could thus potentially reinforce Canada Post's monopoly status. It obviously would be no protection against privatization, but in the current political climate I don't know what can be. To me, the far more concerning element of the reforms is the increase in the price of postage. Again, I doubt that this will spell the end of a public post office, but it is nonetheless a significant increase. Prices will be going up by 22 cents when buying stamps in packs and by 37 cents when buying individually (although most people protesting the changes are only bothering to mention the higher of these two figures). Given that Canada Post's delivery times are, let's face it, less than impressive, cheapness is one of the few things it has going for it. It perplexes me that the prices increases seem to be of secondary concern to those on the left. Mind you, this whole thing perplexes me to some extent. As I mentioned earlier, community mailboxes are not exactly new; large parts of Canada have been using them for years. If they are such a terrible idea, why the hell are we only hearing it now? Are the people who intend to protest the post office changes going to push for the elimination of all community mailboxes and the restoration of universal door-to-door delivery? Somehow I doubt it. And which of the other cost-saving proposals would they endorse? Reducing delivery to three days a week seems like a much worse option to me. As does closing post offices, which are a fantastically valuable piece of infrastructure which have the potential to perform many useful functions. I don't much like the idea of wage reductions or restraint and, in any case, that would be difficult given the strength of the postal union (although knowing Harper he might just legislate it through). Prices increases certainly aren't ideal, as I've already said. Community mailboxes seem like a pretty reasonable solution, given that. Is it ideal? Not really. There's no denying that door-to-door delivery is more convenient. And, even if the job reductions are done by attrition, I'm not thrilled with a reduction in the size of the public sector. It's yet another reduction in the role played in the economy by Crown corporations, further removing from people's consciousness the idea of public enterprise performing a useful function. (Particularly disturbing is that the government has appointed a CEO of Canada Post who came from a company that operates privatized post offices.) What's more, there are alternatives to the reduction in service, other sources of revenue which Canada Post could pursue. Post offices could take over some of the functions of Service Canada, for example. It would be far more convenient for people, considering there are many more post offices than Service Canada bureaus. But far more interesting is the potential for Canada Post to offer banking services, as described in this Toronto Star article . This isn't nearly as strange an idea as it seems, as postal banks are common in Europe and other parts of the world. In fact, Britain's old Gyro Bank—the name of their postal bank— was (prior to its privatization in the ‘80s) possibly the single most successful example of public enterprise, introducing many innovations and scaring the private banking sector into shaping up its act. A similar scheme in Canada would be an excellent idea even on its own merit. It could likely offer Canadians superior levels of service (certainly many more branches) than existing banks currently provide and could be used to invest in socially useful projects. What's more, it would almost certainly provide Canada Post with enough revenue to make the current service reductions unnecessary. Perhaps it would be enough to pay for universal door-to-door delivery (although I honestly have no idea about that). So there's no doubt that there are alternatives to the service reductions at Canada Post. Ones that would promote socialist ideals such as public ownership. But I honestly don't see these service reductions as leading to the destruction or privatization of Canada Post. They will, at worst, be a minor inconvenience for Canadians. Let's try to keep things in perspective. *I should note here that the changes will more troublesome for seniors. Perhaps there could be a compromise made where you get door-to-door delivery if you are over a certain age? But in any case, most seniors who live in their own houses are fairly spry.","tags":"Canada Post Crown Corporations Door-to-Door Mail","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/denouncing-the-dumb-diatribe-on-the-discontinuation-of-door-to-door-delivery.html","title":"Denouncing the Dumb Diatribe on the Discontinuation of Door-to-Door Delivery"},{"text":"If you are impatient and don't want to read my no doubt fascinating account of the inspiration for and development process of the software I've designed, you can skip down to here to read what it does and how to install it. Conetroller icon One of the many great things about Christmas time is the lack of homework. It means that I finally have the chance to work on some of the little personal projects that I've been wanting to do. One such project, of course, is writing some blog posts. The other major project is the subject of this post. Thanks to the wonders of the Internet I now watch almost all movies and TV shows on my computer. (And no, I am not downloading them illegally.) Well, I say on my computer: actually via my computer would be more accurate, as I use an HDMI cable to play them on my television set. The problem with this arrangement is that it prevents me from using my computer for anything else while the video is playing because: The two monitor display features on my computer leave something to be desired. My computer has to stay on my desk, connected to the HDMI cable, which is a terribly angle to actually see the TV from. However, it so happens that I have a spare Raspberry Pi (a cheap mini-computer, one of which hosts this blog) and a spare HDMI cable. It struck me that surely there was some way I could set up the Raspberry Pi to play my videos for me. After some reading I discovered that the VLC Media Player can be controlled via a Telnet interface. For those of you who are not as tech-savvy, Telnet is an old piece of software that can be used to remotely log onto computers in the command line. It long ago fell out of favour due to security issues and has been replaced by software called SSH . However, as I will only be accessing the Pi over my local network, security isn't much of an issue and Telnet will be fine. Now, I could simply log into VLC over Telnet and control it via the command line. This actually wouldn't be so bad, but I felt like there were nicer, tidier alternatives. So instead I set to work writing a program in Python which could provide a graphical user interface ( GUI ) for the Telnet controls. This was actually quite a new experience for me, as almost all of my previous programming experience has been in writing little scripts to process data and which have, at most, a command line interface (although more often than not I just program my specifications directly into the code itself—so-called \"hard-coding\"). What little experience I have with GUIs has all been for Windows, using a framework not available on Linux. So I had to learn how to work with a set of software libraries called GTK + 3. GTK + is one of the two major frameworks used to design GUIs on Linux, the other being QT . One thing that was nice is that there is a piece of software out there called Glade which allows you to design GTK interfaces visually and then import them into your code (rather than have to create the whole interface using code only). It's a bit rough around the edges, but certainly better than having to create the interface manually. Conetroller interface And so, I now have a working piece of software that will allow you to control a remote instance of VLC . So far I have only been able to test it on an instance running on my own computer, but I see no reason why it would work any differently if VLC is on a different machine. And thus, I present to you: Conetroller v0.2.* I am posting the code for download here , if anyone is interested. Currently it is only able to run on Linux (there's a good chance it would work on Mac OSX too), although it shouldn't be too difficult to port it to Windows, if you want to. It can be installed by executing the following in a terminal: wget redshadesofgreen.raspctl.com/attachments/conetroller-0-2.tar.gz tar -zxvf conetroller-0-2.tar.gz cd v0.2/ sudo ./install.sh This installation technique is known to work in Linux Mint Debian Edition, and has not been tested anywhere else. However, I didn't do anything too exotic in terms of directory layout, so it should work with most Linux distributions, and certainly most Debian-based distros (eg: Ubuntu). Make sure to take a look at the README file. No other documentation is provided, but the interface is pretty simple and you should be able to figure it out. If you have any question or problems, post them in the comments section below. Current features include: Adding items to the playlist (using a URL or filepath) Clearing the playlist of items Play, pause, stop, skip forwards, and skip backwards buttons Displaying items currently on playlist Ability to scroll through video Recalling the most recent VLC instance logged into at the beginning of each session Bugs, missing features, and other short-comings: No indication is given as to which playlist item is currently being played (it is unclear if this can be added while using the Telnet interface) No ability to select an item from the playlist (likely will be added in future versions) No ability to remember passwords (it would be insecure to store these unencrypted in a plain text file, as was done with other login information). Future versions may include integration with Gnome Keyring to overcome this. No comments included in the source code—I'll fix this sooner or later, although I think it should be fairly easy to follow even without them Possible overuse of global variables in the code, rather than passing them to the relevant functions—this may be fixed in future, although I blame some of the peculiarities of Glade for this Flaws aside, I am confident that Conetroller will prove useful to me, and hope it can be useful to others as well. *For those that are unaware, the logo for VLC is a traffic cone.

After all that, all I really want to do is turn my brain off for awhile—not write a few thousand words of polemic. Nonetheless, I'm writing something now, at last. Nothing from the topics listed above. The reasons are, respectively: no one else is interested in me grumbling, I'll write about that if and when the government tries it here, it turns out that the story didn't have as interesting ramifications as I expected, it will come around again next year, I can't be bothered to write something requiring that many brain cells at the moment, and I'm probably being too hard on my comrades. The only reason that I'm writing right now, really, is because I can't sleep. It's becoming something of a problem for me. For a number of years now (it first started when I was still in elementary school, I think) I've had some problems getting to sleep at night. But occasionally I go through spells when it is especially bad. This time it started three weeks ago, during the week when I had four midterms. Presumably it was the stress that started it. But it's more or less continued since then. So now I find myself in this situation: I lie awake at night, totally incapable of getting to sleep. Then, in the morning, I sleep through my alarm(s), wake up at 10 o'clock (which presumably doesn't make it any easier to get to sleep at a reasonable hour the next night), have to rush to class and skip the gym (and possibly breakfast). Then, just to add insult to injury, there's a good chance that I'll find myself nearly falling asleep during class and I'll definitely be falling asleep when I try to do assigned readings. All in all, my situation feels a lot like this: (John Finnemore, the guy who wrote that little song, is an incredibly funny guy whose radio sitcom Cabin Pressure I would most definitely recommend.) So, I sit up late at night, writing inanely about my inability to sleep. Will this be of any interest to you, dear reader? God knows. Probably not, actually, but insomnia or not I'm not feeling quite alert or clever enough at this time in the evening to write about anything more intellectual.

In any case, something which I have been finding increasingly irksome is when people talk about something \"growing exponentially,\" when all that they really mean is that it is growing really quickly. I guess I shouldn't really blame them for this, seeing as it's more the lousy math education standards which are to blame. But still, I do wish that they could get this in their heads: just because it's growing quickly doesn't mean that it's growing exponentially! Let me back up a bit. For those of you with a bit of mathematical or scientific background this will be review, but I'll include it in case of the unlikely even that there is anyone here without a second year university calculus class under their belt. And, given how nerdy/awesome my friends are, that is rather unlikely. Exponential growth refers to something that, over some fixed interval, will increase in size by some constant factor. For example, if the water in my sink is getting higher exponentially, that means it starts off at, say, 1cm deep. After a minute it is 2cm deep. After another minute it is 4cm deep. After another minute it is 8cm deep. Pretty soon my whole apartment will be full of water, the landlord will be asking some difficult questions, and I'll be wishing that I'd chosen a drier example with which to make my point. A related concept is exponential decay. This is essentially the same thing, except here the quantity decreases by some constant factor. For example, say I have a chocolate bar with eight segments and in the first minute I eat half of it (four pieces). Wanting to savour it, over the next minute I eat half of the remaining chocolate, or two pieces. Wanting to stretch out my chocolate still longer, the next minute I eat only 1 piece. The next minute I eat only half a piece. This process continues and I never actually finish the chocolate bar. Of course, this example is totally unrealistic: in reality I would have eaten the whole chocolate bar within the first minute. The thing is, the never-quite-vanishing chocolate bar exhibits exponential behaviour, while most things that people call exponential do not. The thing about exponential growth is that it tends to explode; it will eventually start growing so quickly that it just can't continue. Take population growth, for example. Populations are often thought of as growing exponentially. But this can not last forever. Eventually there won't be enough food and the population will level off. Whenever I see something referred to as \"increasing exponentially,\" my immediate reaction is to ask for a plot of the data or the chi-squared value for an exponential fit. For reasons that I explained above, it is almost certainly not growing exponentially. It might be growing quickly, but that is not at all the same thing. So please, spare us neurotic math-geeks a bit of unnecessary squirming and describe the trend properly.","tags":"Personal Mathematics Pet Peeve","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/on-the-abuse-of-exponentiation-in-colloquial-communication.html","title":"On the Abuse of Exponentiation in Colloquial Communication"},{"text":"Well, it's that time of year again. The air is turning cold (or, in today's case, rainy), the last pay-cheque from my summer job went into my back account, I've made sure I'm stocked up on all of the supplies I'll need, and another semester is about to start. I'll be entering the third and penultimate year of my astrophysics degree (my god, it's scary how quickly the time passes). I guess I'm supposed to be dreading this time of year, but I'm really not. I've had a 4+ month break and now I'm sufficiently recharged to be ready to start school again. Quite honestly, classes will be a nice change of pace, after spending four months of writing data analysis scripts for one of my profs. Not that there is anything wrong with doing that for a summer job—it was a nice change from classes at the start. But, as they say, variety is the spice of life. So learning some actual physics again, rather than just crunching numbers, sounds good to me. The other reason I'm not sad that school is starting again is because my social life actually improves during the semester. All of my friends in Halifax are classmates and only a few of them were around campus over the summer. And none of them were other people from my year. So outside of office hours (when we shouldn't really be talking much anyway) I had virtually no social life. Now, though, there will be plenty of people in the physics major's work-room (well, we get some work done there, anyway) to talk to and plenty of time spent together doing homework. Honestly, hours spent collaborating on homework sounds altogether more enjoyable than hours spent in isolation killing time. So, all things considered, I'm kind of glad that school is starting again. Just not quite as glad as I will be when it's over come May.","tags":"University Summer Physics Astrophysics","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/back-for-another-year-of-physics-and-phun.html","title":"Back for Another Year of Physics and Phun"},{"text":"Well, my old laptop was dying. At least I think it was. In any case, I wasn't waiting around until the semester started to find out—better to get a new computer now when I had time to get it configured properly. And so, a week and a half ago I found myself with a brand new ASUS laptop. It's not actually an ultrabook but it is still pretty thin. It has a 24GB solid-state drive (more than enough to hold my operating system), a 750GB mechanical hard drive, an Intel i5 processor, an optical disc drive, and a 14\" screen. Overall I'm quite happy with my choice. The laptop came with Windows 8 installed. I was not having that. The choice now became what version of Linux to use. The obvious choice would have been Linux Mint , which I have used ever since moving to Linux. This distribution has the advantage of being ready to use immediately after installation. I'm also very impressed by their Cinnamon Desktop Environment . However, the trade-off in a distribution being easy to use is that it also somewhat inefficient when it comes to hardware usage. Additionally, in order to upgrade Linux Mint you must totally re-install the operating system. To put it lightly, this is a frig. Another Linux distribution which I'd heard interesting things about is called Arch Linux . In a sense, Arch is the polar opposite of Linux Mint. Once you've installed it, you have a command-line interface with a basic software set installed. And that's it. Everything else, including device drivers and a graphical interface, you must install yourself. However, this ensures that there will be absolutely no bloat on your computer. Arch Linux also has the advantage that you never have to install a new version of the operating system: all of the components can be upgraded in exactly the same way that you'd upgrade any other software. (For those who are familiar with Linux, this means that you just keep the OS up-to-date by applying the upgrade command with the package-manager.) For some reason I decided that I wanted to give Arch a try. A big part of the appeal is not having to re-install the OS for upgrades. I was also enticed by the amount of control I'd be able to have over my system. And I guess at the end of the day I wanted the challenge—I enjoy tinkering with my computer, and I'd reached the limits of what I could do with Mint. In other words, I chose it out of masochism. The installation process is considerably more complicated than that for Linux Mint. However, in principle it isn't too difficult, thanks to the wonderful documentation provided. Unfortunately, my computer has one of those awful new UEFI motherboards. This, combined with some feature called \"secure boot\" meant that even getting my computer to detect the installation disc was a struggle. Then, once I finally got Arch installed, the UEFI boot-loader was convinced that there was no operating system present. To be fair, I tried installing Linux Mint and encountered the same problem. Several attempts later, I finally found a work-around that got the boot-loader to see the operating systems. At this point I was past the worst. The next step was to create a new account for myself. Initially when you install Linux (well, in more traditional setups like Arch, anyway) there will only be one user, called \"root.\" Root is capable of doing anything on the computer—it can delete or edit any file. This is actually quite dangerous (giving rise to the expressions \"He who plays with root kills [file-]tree\") as you can potentially delete something vital for the operation of your computer. Thus it is best to create a separate account for every-day work on the computer and only to use root when necessary (such as when installing new software). Speaking of installing software, that was the next step. First were the drivers for things like sound, video, and my laptop's trackpad. Next came a graphical user interface ( GUI ). Linux uses the X Window System for this. However, all that X gives is the ability for the computer to render graphical windows—you can't do very much with them by default, and you certainly won't have a desktop with icons. For that I needed to install a Desktop Environment. My first choice for a desktop environment was Cinnamon. It has a fairly traditional layout (which I like—I don't know why so many projects are trying to force totally new interfaces on people) but modern looking visual features. Unfortunately, Cinnamon's behaviour with Arch was distinctly underwhelming. There were numerous problems, but probably the most frustrating was that I couldn't get any of the applets (such as the one which shows the weather) to work. Additionally, I realized how tricky it can be to configure some of the visual elements of Cinnamon. On Linux Mint this isn't really a problem because most of the work is done for you in advance, but I couldn't seem to get it looking quite the way I wanted on Arch. So I gave up on Cinnamon. My second choice was MATE . MATE is a fork of an older desktop environment (now discontinued) called GNOME 2. MATE was created when GNOME 2 was replaced by the horrendous GNOME 3. MATE doesn't (by default) have quite the same level of prettiness as Cinnamon, but on the other hand it is far easier to configure. So I installed MATE and almost immediately realized that I could get rid of Cinnamon: all of MATE 's features worked immediately. So goodbye Cinnamon. After installing a few more themes, MATE looked almost as good as Cinnamon, too! Finally I needed to install my preferred applications. It was the usual sort of list: LibreOffice , emacs , Banshee , Geany , and Texmaker . Perhaps my favourite feature of Arch Linux is the Arch User Repository. This is a collection of source-code for software which would not be popular enough (or is still too experimental) to warrant being maintained in the official software repositories. However, Arch users can prepare the source code themselves so that it can easily be compiled into a package and then installed using the normal package manager. This means that there are some obscure, but great, pieces of software which can be installed with ease, such as a client for my Seafile Cloud Server (an open source replacement for Dropbox) and Pelican , which I use to produce this blog. And this brings me more-or-less to where I am now. While there are still a few things I have left to do, at this point I have a fully functional computer running Arch Linux.","tags":"Linux Arch Linux Laptop MATE Desktop","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/new-computer-new-linux-distribution.html","title":"New Computer, New Linux Distribution"},{"text":"Yesterday I happened to read two very interesting articles, which at first glance would appear to be entirely unrelated. One was in New Scientist magazine and explained that, although GDP has risen fairly steadily in the west for the past several decades, the Genuine Progress Indicator ( GPI ) has slowly been declining since 1978. The GPI essentially tries to adjust the value of GDP to account for social and environmental problems (such as inequality and pollution). The other article was an opinion piece in The Guardian by two Canadian academics and activists that I am rather fond of: Leo Panitch and Sam Gindin. Here they explained why we can't expect any attempt at a second New Deal in Europe as a way of combating the economic crisis: in short, without a threat of something more radical (ie: all-out socialism), the ruling classes see no need to engage in progressive economic policies. This set of graphs, taken from New Scientist ‘s website, shows that global GDP and GPI rose fairly steadily from 1950 to the late 1970s. This corresponds with the period in which Keynesianism ruled. This usually took the form of social democracy: public ownership of key industries, strong trade unions, lots of regulation, a large welfare state, etc. As Panitch and Gindin explain, the reason that this could be implemented was because there were powerful working-class forces at work which could have led to the outright abolition of capitalism. Faced with the prospect of losing everything, the upper classes were willing to sacrifice a little wealth and power in order to pacify the lower classes. This also was reflected in American foreign policy: the US established the Marshall Plan in Europe to ensure that capitalism survived there, thus helping to ensure its survival in the USA as well. As you can see from the above plot, these policies were quite successful at ensuring increased quality of life for all. However, the welfare state was always dependent on the success in the private sector for revenue (with a few exceptions, nationalised industries were not used as major revenue sources). Thus social democracy has always been dependent on continued capital accumulation. And this was its fundamental weakness. When the global slump came in the 1970s (in Britain it was so severe that you see a large decrease in GPI around 1975) it began to put the welfare state in jeopardy. In some countries there were attempts to break away from the dependence on private capital accumulation (the Meidner Plan in Sweden and Mitterrand's nationalisation of banks in France) but the working class was not strong enough to bring these attempts to a successful conclusion. In all countries it eventually proved necessary to start scaling back the welfare state and, to one degree or another, abandon Keynesian policies in favour of Monetarist ones. This new economic orthodoxy is usually referred to as neoliberalism. In Britain this took the form of Margaret Thatcher. In the US it was Ronald Reagan. In Canada it was Brian Mulroney. All of them implemented policies which were harmful to the average citizen. Trade unions were weakened and could no longer act as a force against income inequality. Industries previously devoted to the public good were privatised and used to enrich a select few. Cuts to social spending hurt the poor by making once universal services available only to those that could pay. Deregulation made it easier for companies to pollute the environment and the emphasis on private profit meant that environmental costs were ignored. The reasons for declining GPI are clear. What is less clear is what to do about it. Panitch and Gindin show that today we lack the popular forces which made social democracy viable in the post-war period. There are no significant examples of non-capitalist states and few radical trade unions. In the minds of most people there is no alternative to capitalism. Anti-capitalist parties are small and marginal (with a few exceptions, such as in Greece and, to a lesser extent, Spain and Portugal). The business class need not fear the imposition of socialism; they know that the working class is currently too disorganized to be a serious threat and thus see no need to pursue a policy of appeasement. Now, this situation will very likely change in the coming years and decades, but there are a few questions we should address as we work to create new working-class institutions. One is what these movements should demand. Many progressive economists talk about things like reregulating the banks and implementing a Tobin tax. However, as explained above, we are unlikely to be able to impose these reformist measures without the threat of something far more radical. And, knowing what happened the last time the left settled for reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it, we should not be content merely to use socialism as a threat. This time we must implement it. Social democracy died in the 1980s and there is no point in trying to bring back the dead. Rosa Luxemburg's sentiments are more true now than ever: \"Bourgeois society stands at the crossroads, either transition to Socialism or regression into Barbarism.\"","tags":"GDP Social Democracy Leo Panitch Sam Gindin British Politics Neoliberalism Socialism","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/why-social-democracy-was-great-and-why-it-isnt-the-answer.html","title":"Why Social Democracy Was Great and Why It Isn't the Answer"},{"text":"I was delighted to discover, several months ago now, that BBC had produced radio adaptations of some of the books by my favourite author, Terry Pratchett .

For those of you who don't know, Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister in the UK during the ‘80s and oversaw the implementation of neoliberalism. She succeeded in crushing the trade unions, scaling back the welfare state, deregulating the financial sector, deindustrialising Britain, and privatising a substantial portion of public assets (including utilities, airlines, buses, coal mines, steel manufacturing, and aerospace, among other things). These policies saw a massive increase in income inequality and unemployment and are often referred to as \"class warfare from above.\" Anyway, I received a (fairly typical) response that Thatcher saved Britain for anarchy and bankruptcy and that while her policies were unpleasant at the time, they were necessary. There are even plenty of people on the centre-left who say things like this. It irritates me to no end, but I figured that it was best to avoid getting dragged into a political debate in public. Of course, this being me, it continued to bother me through the day, so I've written some of my thoughts on the matter here. Now, to be fair, Britain's economy was a mess before she came in. It was also a mess for quite awhile after she came in. In fact, initially she made things worse. When the recovery did come it was on the back of the finance \"industry,\" and we all know how that turned out… However, there is no denying that the British economy was in need of major restructuring. Maggie famously justified her policies by saying that \"There is no alternative.\" This is often referred to as TINA and this is what the Thatcher-apologists have unwittingly bought into. And, in a sense, they aren't wrong. There was no alternative—if we insisted on maintaining capitalism. However, at about the same time that the Thatcherites came to power we also saw the rise of the Bennites. They were a left-wing movement within the Labour Party, centred around the MP Tony Benn. They advocated nationalising the financial institutions and much of large industry. These new public enterprises were to be administered by the workers. They felt that these measures, combined with a degree of industrial planning (which would, if I recall, have seen a substantial retooling of factories) and import substitution would help to restart Britain's economy. Actually, the Labour Party was elected in the 1970s on a watered-down version of this platform. However, they did not have the guts to pursue it and instead implemented an early, watered-down version of Thatcherism. This prompted a massive strike-wave, referred to as The Winter of Discontent (the anarchy to which Thatcher apologists refer). The irony is that the Labour Party brought it upon themselves. There were alternatives proposed. At least one was even put forward the Cabinet by Tony Benn, but was viewed as too radical. So, you can not justify what Margaret Thatcher did by saying that it was what was necessary in order to get Britain back on track. There were other options available which were never tried. What was true, however, was that the post-War class-compromise (the Keynesian mixed-economy) had outlive its usefulness. As the ‘80s dawned, class struggle was destined to begin anew. The likes of Tony Benn tried, and very nearly succeeded, at leading the working class to victory. However, Mrs. Thatcher was more successful with her ruling-class offensive. When you apologise for Thatcher, this class warfare from above is what you are justifying. I suspect, or at least hope, that fewer people would be willing to defend her if they thought of it that way.

Having written two serious posts, one of which was quite work-intensive, I figured that there wasn't much point in continuing if no one was going to read it. So it's time to tell the world! I admit that I'm still a little bit hesitant. This blog will contain some rather personal information. I've already made my sexual orientation quite clear on Facebook, but people wouldn't find out unless they actually went looking. However, now that I've posted a link to this blog I will essentially have come out to the world. Not that I really mind—I'm not at all ashamed of who I am. It's just a bit of a big step. What's more, this will essentially be me officially \"coming out\" as a socialist. Ironically, if anything I find that scarier. Certainly I'm not quite ready to tell my parents that yet. They were fine with my being gay, but their love and support might only go so far… I jest. Mostly.

I'm not quite sure why. Perhaps it just makes me think of Isaac Asimov's psychohistory . In any case, I read a very interesting article in New Scientist magazine the other day which gave a mathematical and statistical examination of protest, in particular the recent protests in Brazil. It discussed how this sort of unrest spreads in much the same way as diseases and forest fires. Once something starts off the unrest (in the Brazilian case, an increase in bus fairs), unrelated long-time grievances can come to the fore and cause surprising amounts of civil disobedience that can persist even after the original issue is dealt with. Frankly, I'm surprised that you'd need a mathematical model to know that; to anyone who's studied history it should be common sense. Another interesting statement that was made is that it is the \"newly prosperous,\" afraid of losing their new found success, who tend to be protesting. It reminds me of what one of my high school history teachers used to say about revolutions: you don't get revolutions when people have no hope but when you give them hope and then try to take it away. Rabble-raisers everywhere take note. Other factors which were noted to facilitate the spread of protest include high food prices, high numbers of unemployed young people, and access to social media. The latter-most is said to \"boost a protest's transmission rate through susceptible societies.\" I wonder if, perhaps, part of the reason why youth are more likely to spread civil unrest is because they are more adept at using social media? It is also speculated that recent protests relate to a societal trend away from hierarchy and towards more horizontalist means of organization. One thing which irked me about the article was that it had a somewhat condescending tone towards protesters. Notice how it compared the spread of protests to the spread of diseases. While perhaps mathematically accurate, that is not a pleasant comparison, is it? Of course, as a socialist with a somewhat revolutionary bend, I suppose I hold an unusually positive view on protest. Something which worries me a little bit is whether this sort of knowledge could be used to suppress protest and dissent. I can certainly imagine governments wanting to do that. For those of us wanting to change the world, it would be a very large impediment if the ruling classes used mathematics and sociology to try to enforce the status quo. Of course, a different approach would be for them to attempt to understand the root cause of unrest and to fix it. Would this be a good thing? It would certainly improve the lives of people in the short term. But would it be demobilizing? Would we not just end up with a friendlier, reformed version of the world we live in today, with all of the old class structures still intact? In effect, would it simply lead to a redoing of Keynesian social democracy? I'll leave that debate aside for now. In any case, I suspect that it is irrelevant: the response of the ruling class to Occupy Wall Street seems to show a complete disinterest in appeasement. And, in any case, Keynesian policies failed once and would almost certainly fail if tried again. So now we must ask ourselves, how is this information useful to activists and to the people who organize these protests? Can it inform our strategies and tactics? Can we use it to our advantage? Is it ethical to do so? After all, you'd essentially be manipulating people. I suppose my view is that this sort of research will allow activists to anticipate if a protests will become widespread. This will allow us radicals to be prepared somewhat in advance. For those who work on theoretical analysis, research such as this may lend a mathematical or even an empirical basis for what at present feels at times like nothing more that intuition and vague guess. That is when I'll be convinced that we have truly \" Scientific Socialism .\"","tags":"Mathematics Protest Activism Brazil","loc":"https://politicalphysicist.github.io/the-mathematics-of-protest.html","title":"The Mathematics of Protest"},{"text":"Well, I've decided to start a blog.
