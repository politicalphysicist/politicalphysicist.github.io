            <p>As you may know, Canada Post <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/canada-post-to-phase-out-urban-home-mail-delivery-1.2459618">recently announced</a>
that they will be making some changes. Two in particular are of note: a price 
increase on stamps and the phasing out of door-to-door delivery in urban 
areas. The latter measure will allow the elimination of about 8000 jobs. 
However, thanks to the strength of the postal workers&#8217; union, no one will 
actually be fired; rather, the workforce reductions will be achieved by&nbsp;attrition.</p>
<p><img alt="Community mailboxes, of the sort I've grown up with." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/mailboxes.jpg" /></p>
<p>Predictably, the left has had a conniption over all of this. A typical example
can be <a href="http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/views-expressed/2013/12/canada-post-not-on-life-support-it-being-murdered">found here</a>. 
In particular, they have denounced the elimination of door-to-door delivery. 
Given my politics, you may be expecting a similar reaction here. But there 
you would be 
wrong. Many parts of Canada already use the community mailboxes which will 
become the norm over the next few years. It so happens that I grew up in one 
such area. It was a daily routine to either walk and get the mail or to swing 
by the mailbox when we were driving somewhere. In the case of the latter, the 
community mailbox arrangement took at most an extra two minutes out of our 
day. In the case of the former, it forced us to get a bit of fresh air and 
exercise. Contrary to what many claim, the scheme is not particularly 
inconvenient* and certainly is not going to cause the destruction of Canada&nbsp;Post.</p>
<p>Actually, if anything the opposite is true. Sometimes people will talk about 
ending Canada Post&#8217;s monopoly and introducing competition into mail 
delivery. I
tend to be suspicious of such proposals, but if the proper regulations
were in place then I find it hard to actually justify the government monopoly 
on door-to-door daily mail delivery. Community mail boxes, however, make this
much more difficult in my opinion. Do we really want to allow every upstart
mail-delivery company to have the keys to everyone&#8217;s mailboxes? I think that
would be rather hard to justify (especially given that the mailboxes are
government property) and could thus potentially reinforce Canada
Post&#8217;s monopoly status. It obviously would be no protection against 
privatization, but in the current political climate I don&#8217;t know what can&nbsp;be.</p>
<p>To me, the far more concerning element of the reforms is the increase in the
price of postage. Again, I doubt that this will spell the end of a public post
office, but it is nonetheless a significant increase. Prices will be going up
by 22 cents when buying stamps in packs and by 37 cents when buying
individually (although most people protesting the changes are only 
bothering to
mention the higher of these two figures). Given that Canada Post&#8217;s delivery
times are, let&#8217;s face it, less than impressive, cheapness is one of the few 
things it has going for it. It perplexes me that the prices increases seem to
be of secondary concern to those on the&nbsp;left.</p>
<p>Mind you, this whole thing perplexes me to some extent. As I mentioned 
earlier, community mailboxes are not exactly new; large parts of Canada have
been using them for years. If they are such a terrible idea, why the hell are
we only hearing it now? Are the people who intend to protest the post office
changes going to push for the elimination of <em>all</em> community mailboxes and the
restoration of universal door-to-door delivery? Somehow I doubt it. And which
of the other cost-saving proposals would they endorse? Reducing delivery to
three days a week seems like a much worse option to me. As does closing post
offices, which are a fantastically valuable piece of 
infrastructure which have 
the potential to perform many useful functions. I don&#8217;t much like the idea
of wage reductions or restraint and, in any case, that would be difficult
given the strength of the postal union (although knowing Harper he might just
legislate it through). Prices increases certainly aren&#8217;t ideal, 
as I&#8217;ve already
said. Community mailboxes seem like a pretty reasonable solution, given&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Is it ideal? Not really. There&#8217;s no denying that door-to-door delivery 
is more 
convenient. And, even if the job reductions are done by attrition, I&#8217;m not 
thrilled with a reduction in the size of the public sector. It&#8217;s yet another
reduction in the role played in the economy by Crown corporations, further
removing from people&#8217;s consciousness the idea of public enterprise performing
a useful function. (Particularly disturbing is that the government has
appointed a <span class="caps">CEO</span> of Canada Post who came from a company that operates
privatized post offices.) What&#8217;s more, 
there are alternatives to the reduction in
service, other sources of revenue which Canada Post could pursue. Post offices
could take over some of the functions of Service Canada, for example. It would
be far more convenient for people, considering there are many more 
post offices than Service Canada&nbsp;bureaus.</p>
<p>But far more interesting is the potential for
Canada Post to offer banking services, as described in 
<a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/12/20/postal_savings_bank_could_save_mail_delivery_walkom.html">this Toronto Star article</a>. 
This isn&#8217;t nearly as strange an idea as it seems, as postal banks are
common in Europe and other parts of the world. 
In fact, Britain&#8217;s old Gyro Bank&#8212;the name of their postal bank&#8212;
was (prior to its privatization in the &#8216;80s) possibly the single most 
successful example of public enterprise, introducing many innovations and 
scaring the private banking sector into shaping up its act.
A similar scheme in
Canada would be an excellent idea even on its own merit. It could likely
offer Canadians superior levels of service (certainly many more branches) than
existing banks currently provide and could be used to invest in 
socially useful projects.
What&#8217;s more, it would almost certainly provide Canada Post with 
enough revenue 
to make the current service reductions unnecessary. Perhaps it would be enough
to pay for universal door-to-door delivery (although I honestly have no idea 
about&nbsp;that).</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s no doubt that there are alternatives to the service reductions at
Canada Post. Ones that would promote socialist ideals such as 
public ownership. But I honestly don&#8217;t see these service reductions as 
leading to the destruction or privatization of Canada Post. They will, at 
worst, be a minor inconvenience for Canadians. Let&#8217;s try to keep things in&nbsp;perspective.</p>
<p>*I should note here that the changes will more troublesome for seniors. 
Perhaps there could be a compromise made where you get door-to-door delivery
if you are over a certain age? But in any case, most seniors who live in 
their own houses are fairly&nbsp;spry.</p>
