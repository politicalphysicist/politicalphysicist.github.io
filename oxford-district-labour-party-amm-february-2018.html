            <p><a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-02-09-amm/amm-12jan2018-minutes.docx">Minutes of last meeting</a> were
approved, as was the <a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-02-09-amm/amm-9feb2018-agenda.docx">agenda for this meeting</a>.</p>
<p>At start of the meeting we had to decide whether to debate a motion on
the <span class="caps">NHS</span> or on Haringey (both submitted by the same branch). Haringey
was selected.</p>
<h2>Giampi Alhadeff, Speaking on Brexit</h2>
<p>General secretary of the European Parliamentary Labour Party. Started with lots of waffle, country divided, etc. Identified 4 issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>The union of the <span class="caps">UK</span> (due to the Northern Ireland situation),
   especially with the Good Friday agreement.</li>
<li>Jobs and prosperity. Was at lots of <span class="caps">WTO</span> summits (including Seattle)
   and the negotiators are tough. Trade with other countries will hurt
   British sectors, losing jobs. Can’t make up <span class="caps">EU</span> trade with overseas
   trade. Any international business will move out (according to
   Japanese Ambassador)</li>
<li>Health <span class="amp">&amp;</span> safety, workers’ rights, and the environment. This is what
   the right-wingers talk about when they mean “red tape”. Want a
   Singapore for European (which won’t happen, but anyway). <span class="caps">UK</span> will
   diverge with <span class="caps">EU</span> as latter introduces new laws.</li>
<li>Big issues facing the world: China developing internationally,
   Russia and its meddling abroad, climate change, artificial
   intelligence (peace, business, war, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Leaving the <span class="caps">EU</span> will impact the <span class="caps">UK</span>’s ability to deal with these
issues. It will address them but the <span class="caps">UK</span> won’t have a voice.</p>
<p>Problem for Labour is 2/3 or members want to remain while 2/3 of
constituencies want to leave. He believes Labour must say that regions
which voted leave will be hit hardest, so let’s remain.</p>
<h2>Brexit Motion</h2>
<p>A range of views on this. I pointed out some of the downsides of the
<span class="caps">EU</span>. It was amended to remove the talk of a second referendum. The
motion now reads “This meeting believes that the Labour Party’s policy
on Brexit should be to remain in the Customs Union”. This was
overwhelmingly carried
with about 17 votes against and 15 abstentions. Many questioned what
the point of the motion was given that the customs union doesn’t exist
as an institution. Liz noticed that a lot of Momentum people voted for
the motion.</p>
<h2>Parliamentary Report from Anneliese Dodds</h2>
<p>Praised that we had such a passionate but still civil debate on
Brexit. Thinks party should press harder on the customs union issue
because government is currently week on that, especially with the <span class="caps">EU</span>
expressing doubts about the whole situation in Ireland. Has been
arguing in parliament to support at least <em>a</em> and possibly <em>the</em>
customs union so that Tories will split on it. Also wants to maintain
unity, as election could be coming earlier than expected.</p>
<p>Managed to get a vote against a tax treaty rejected, as these are used
for tax avoidance (in the guise of international aid). A few similar
bills which were coming up seem to have vanished… Also pushing
transparency for trust. Other <span class="caps">EU</span> countries are coming out against that
but not the <span class="caps">UK</span>. The lack of transparency is abused for money
laundering, etc. Dealing with some tax issues, particularly how
raising the income tax threshold has <em>not</em> (as the government likes to
pretend) solved poverty. Cuts to benefits have had a much bigger
impact. Pushing on the <span class="caps">NHS</span> as the winter crisis is far worse than in
previous years. Sent out an emergency budget for health which showed
where money could be found to help address these issues. Managed to
get a requirement that homes be fit for habitation, now need to make
sure tenants can actually exercise those rights.</p>
<p>Some discussion of Helen and Douglas House (a local hospice). It seems
to be having to close a lot of services because there is no public
money going into it. Talk about trying to get the <span class="caps">CCG</span> to reconsider
given the situation. Meeting gave unanimous permission to send a
letter in our name.</p>
<h2>Motions</h2>
<h3>Afrin</h3>
<p>Materials were circulated about this. Basically this is Turkey
attacking the Kurdish, <span class="caps">YPG</span>-controlled areas in northern Syria. Lots of
war crimes, civilian deaths, targeting of women. No one from
international community has spoken up, so the drafter put forward this
motion. Turkey seems to be trying to annex and ethnically cleanse
it. Boris Johnson has effectively supported the invasion saying
Turkey has a right to keep its borders secure. Emotional pleas to
help. One speaker checked to ensure her ammendment noting how the <span class="caps">UK</span>
is a <span class="caps">NATO</span> member was included (it was) and anther spoke in favour. The
motion was unanimously carried.</p>
<h3>Haringey and the <span class="caps">NEC</span></h3>
<p>Pointed out how <span class="caps">HDV</span> is a continuation of the disastrous privatisation
agenda which Labour now opposes. Haringey’s attempt at the <span class="caps">HDV</span> split
the council and went against CLPs, MPs, unions. <span class="caps">NEC</span> intervened on
behalf of councillors and union members in a very measured
manner. This was all within party rules. Critics have gained massive
coverage in the media, so important to put our views forward. Dan
seconded and drew attention to how broad the opposition to the <span class="caps">HDV</span>
is. Motion through the <span class="caps">NEC</span> was unanimously supported (after an
amendment). Luke Akehurst spoke against, claiming not because he
supported <span class="caps">HDV</span> but because the it fell within spectrum of allowable
policies to be decided on a local level. Nonetheless seemed to speak
in support of the <span class="caps">HDV</span>. Claims new council houses, even under Labour,
will be built privately. Another person said it wasn’t our place to
stick the oar in. Others pointed out that our council leader was one
of those condemning the <span class="caps">NEC</span>, making it our business. Overwhelmingly
carried with 6 against and 20 abstentions. </p>
<h3>Rough sleeping</h3>
<p>Cherry informed me a row is brewing over the provision of this to open
shelters when even one night is predicted to be below freezing (rather
than 3 consecutive nights). The Labour Club says won’t support any
candidates failing to support this, while the council is saying won’t
support candidates who are in favour of it. Momentum councillors (and
prospective councillors) are willing to break rank on this, but best
to get this through at the <span class="caps">CLP</span> level to try to force council’s
hand. Richard presented the Southwest Central motion on rough
sleeping. Made a positive case for it, emphasised working with
council, not trying to be confrontational. A Momentum member
(forgotten her name) proposed ammendments supporting rights of
“non-statutory homeless” and civil rights of homeless, which Richard
accepted. These were accepted. Deputy-leader of the council
spoke. Says will be a church open for rough sleepers every night
through January to March. To date have had enough capacity. Says <span class="caps">SWEP</span>
is inefficient way of doing things and could make it difficult to
extend current scheme. Will still vote for motion, but shouldn’t get
too caught up on <span class="caps">SWEP</span>. Unanimously carried.</p>
<h2>Executive Committee Report</h2>
<p>We were sent the <a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-02-09-amm/ec-minutes-18jan2018.docx">full report</a> in
advance.  Advertised dinner with Keir Starmer. Unfair dismissal rally
tomorrow in support of <span class="caps">GMB</span> taxi drivers, marching from city council to
Osney. Speakers on Afrin offering to speak at branch
meetings. Finally, were some forms to join Labour Movement for Europe
(I did not sign up).</p>
<h2><span class="caps">NEC</span> Report</h2>
<p>Left as had to leave to let cold weather shelters set up. In advance
we were sent one report by
<a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-02-09-amm/nec-jan2018-annblack.docx">Ann Black</a> and another by
<a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-02-09-amm/nec-jan2018-petewillsman.docx">Pete Willsman</a>.</p>
