##What we Need

TRANSITION, EVERYTHING RELATES TO EVERYTHING

### Plan for Zero-Carbon

WHOLE SOCIETY PLANNING (CARBON BUDGETS)

NATIONAL COMMITTEE DRAWING UP PLANS, WITH REGIONAL AND SECTORAL
COMMITTEES ALSO REPRESENTED

LOCAL AUTHORITIES ALSO NEED TO DRAW UP OWN PLANS WITHIN NATIONAL FRAMEWORK


### Transport and Housing Developments

ENERGY EFFICIENCY, MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENTS, HIGH DENSITY

PLANNING LAW MUST ACCOUNT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE

COMBAT CAR = FREEDOM IDEA; TRANSIT = FREEDOM

FREE TRANSIT

SOCIAL HOUSING AROUND NEW TRANSIT LINKS TO PREVENT GENTRIFICATION

ELECTRIC TRANSIT (E.G. TROLLEYBUSES, RAIL ELECTRIFICATION)

FOCUS ON THROUGHPUT, CONNECTIONS, RATHER THAN TOP SPEED

OWNERSHIP LEVEL, PROBLEM OF FRAGMENTED LOCAL AUTHORITIES

WHERE VEHICLES ARE NEEDED, ELECTRIFY IF POSSIBLE

LONG DISTANCE ROAD?

WHAT TO DO ABOUT AVIATION? NIGHT TRAINS? BATTERY PLANES? SYNTHETIC
FUELS?


### Those Other Sectors...

AGRICULTURE: MAXIMISE OUTPUT FROM LAND (INCLUDING RESPONSIBLE USE OF
PESTICIDES, GMOs), MINIMISE EMISSIONS 

COMMONLY TOLD WE NEED TO EAT LESS MEAT, BUT HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE DO IT?
GUILT ISN'T POLITICS. CARBON TAX (REGRESSIVE)? HIGH QUALITY PUBLIC
MEAL PROVISION? CENTRALISED GOVERNMENT CATERING, MADE WIDELY
AVAILABLE? https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/01/baked-cod-miso-and-bok-choy-worlds-healthiest-school-lunches-japan-kyushoku

CEMENT AND STEEL NEED FURTHER RESEARCH. IF STEEL NATIONALISED (AS MANY
SUGGESTED WHEN TATA CLOSING DOWN MILL) THEN THIS SHOULD BE A
PRIORITY. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS CARBON CAPTURE FOR USE OR
SEQUESTRATION.

NEED PUBLIC R&D (E.G. NICKI ASHTON'S GREEN CANADA PROPOSAL).

LAND USE MUST BE PART OF CARBON BUDGETS.

THINKING ABOUT NEGATIVE EMISSIONS

### The International Dimension

EVEN IF BRITAIN STOPPED ALL EMISSIONS TOMORROW, WON'T DO MUCH GOOD
UNLESS REST OF WORLD FOLLOWED SUIT, THOUGHT EXAMPLE IS
IMPORTANT

MUST PUT PRESSURE ON OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (TRADE SANCTIONS?)

MUST HELP DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: TRADE AGREEMENTS, TECH TRANSFERS,
DEVELOPMENT AID, BUILDING CLIMATE DEFENCES

DEVELOP INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM FOR HANDLING REFUGEES; WILL LIKELY
REQUIRE BUILDING WHOLE NEW CITIES. NEED HUMANE SYSTEM TO MANAGE MASS
MOVEMENTS OF POPULATION, AVOID STIRRING UP HOSTILITY IN FIRST WORLD

INSURANCE SYSTEM FOR CLIMATE DISASTERS

GEO-ENGINEERING: NEGATIVE EMISSIONS, POSSIBLY AEROSOLS--REQUIRE
MUTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR DECISION MAKING ON GLOBAL SCALE

## Conclusion

CLIMATE CHANGE IS A CHALLENGE OF A SCALE NEVER BEFORE FACED; CLOSEST
COMPARISON IS TOTAL WAR BUT NOW REQUIRES INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

LEVEL OF CLASS STRUGGLE SIMILARLY UNPRECEDENTED; DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE
ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE WITHOUT SOCIALISM, IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE
MITIGATION WITHOUT AT LEAST SOCIAL DEMOCRACY
