            <p>The struggle for socialism is international and the success or failure
of left-wing governments in other countries affect what happens
here. As such, the ongoing degeneration of the Chavez&#8217;s Bolivarian
Revolution in Venezuela have been deeply disheartening and give the
right yet another narrative with which to attack the Labour&nbsp;left.</p>
<p>Comparisons of Corbyn with Chavez and Maduro are silly. The policies
in Labour&#8217;s manifesto were similar to those of Germany or Scandinavia,
not Venezuela. Venezuela&#8217;s economic problems have resulted from what
even a number of left-wing economists have identified as very stupid
policies which are not fundamental to socialism. These include an
unworkable system of fixed exchange rates, a massive over-reliance on
the oil sector, and food prices regulated in a way that cause
shortages and the emergence of a black market. This is coupled with
massive corruption in both the public and private sector. If Maduro
were remotely competent then he could easily begin to address at least some
of these&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>Venezuela is currently an awkward mix of socialism and
capitalism. Large portions of the economy are in public ownership, but
other vital sectors still remain private. Private business isn&#8217;t
willing to cooperate with the socialised sector. Essentially, the
country is at an unstable point which could be resolved by shifting
back towards capitalism or continuing to push towards socialism,
nationalising uncooperative sectors. The former would result in a
decline in living standards for those the government has lifted out of
poverty over the last 20 years (although the recent economic problems
have started doing this anyway). In the case of the latter, rampant
corruption makes it dubious nationalised companies would work in the
public&nbsp;interest.</p>
<p>In the past there were some very encouraging moves towards direct
democratic control over nationalised firms. In some cases (such as
electricity) this took the form of workers&#8217; electing management. Other
enterprises were placed under the control of local &#8220;communal councils&#8221;
which are institutions where all citizens could participate and
vote. These were encouraging developments, but unfortunately the state
has proven unwilling to actually commit to give up power to the
masses. Had Chavez and Maduro done a better job at supporting these
measures then non-corrupt, non-authoritarian public control of the
economy would be possible and could represent part of the solution to
the current&nbsp;crisis.</p>
<p>One of the reasons these problems have been allowed to arise is
that the supporters of the president have little control over what
he does. This is a result of the extremely undemocratic structures of
the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. While its original goal was
to be democratic and engage socialists in the fight for socialism
within the state, it has not turned out this way. Were the party
democratic then it would allow discussion and debate. It could make
Maduro adopt better policies, or force him out if he refused. It could
even have allowed the grassroots to choose a competent
candidate to replace Chavez and not relied on the past president to
anoint his own&nbsp;candidate.</p>
<p>The irony is that attempts by socialists to democratise the Labour
Party along the lines needed in Venezuela are often reported as
intimidation tactics and consolidating control of the
leadership. While it is true that currently it would help the
leadership, as the membership is more politically aligned with Corbyn
than with the bulk of Labour MPs, that is not the point. Or, at least,
it <em>should</em> not be. The desire is to ensure that parliamentary
candidates are representing the views of the membership who campaign
for them. If an <span class="caps">MP</span> (or a leader) are doing a poor job then the
membership should have the ability to get rid of them. Yes, voters
have that capacity too, in that they could elect a different <span class="caps">MP</span>, but
for those whose views align with the Labour Party and who simply
dislike the candidate, accountability to the membership offers a
more meaningful choice. God knows, this would be helpful in Venezuela,
where more and more are falling into the category of supporting
socialism but being fed up with the incompetence and heavy-handedness
of the&nbsp;president.</p>
<p>Of course, for party democracy to work there does have to be critical
thinking and engagement beyond just supporting the leader. This was
often not the case in Venezuela under Chavez, whose personality cult
was at least partially a deliberate strategy; it is easier to rally
people around a messiah than an abstract concept. Too many Labour
members give uncritical support to Corbyn, but there are also
plenty who do not. Even within Momentum you will find activists who
differ with the leadership on issues such as Britain&#8217;s relationship to
the <span class="caps">EU</span> or free movement. This website, owned by one of the men behind
Corbyn&#8217;s leadership campaign, has published material critical of his
policies in areas such economics and energy. It is paramount that we
build on these glimmers of critical engagement within the party if we
want the leadership to be&nbsp;accountable.</p>
<p>Even if we fail in this, we have to ask ourselves whether Britons would allow
the slide into authoritarianism seen in Venezuela. The institutions and
democratic norms of the British state are much stronger than those in
Venezuela. Corbyn&#8217;s hostility towards the military means that they
would be extremely unlikely to go along with him if he tried to consolidate
power, whereas much of the Venezuelan executive comes from the
military. In Britain, the far more likely outcome of a failure in democratic
control would be that of Syriza: a Corbyn government giving into
pressure from capital and simply trying to justify neoliberal policies
in leftist&nbsp;terms.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pulling no punches in my assessment of Maduro&#8217;s regime. Some will
accuse me of lacking solidarity with the Bolivarian government. They
are showing precisely the lack of critical engagement which I have
decried. We can not simply be cheerleaders for politicians, be they
British or Venezuelan. We must call them out when they are going
wrong, or things are unlikely to be corrected. Yes, of course the
opposition in Venezuela has been violent and reactionary. Of course I
denounce it. But how does that improve the situation if the only
alternative is someone who can&#8217;t address the structural issues which
have emboldened the opposition? Of course the opposition have used
underhanded tricks and of course I denounce that too. But why then
should I excuse any underhanded behaviour of Maduro?  Of course
Western politicians are condemning Venezuela while remaining silent
about autocratic regimes elsewhere. But we on the left normally
condemn the moral standards of the right, so why should we be so quick
to adopt them&nbsp;ourselves?</p>
<p>I want socialism to succeed in this country. That cause will be
greatly helped by it succeeding in other countries. Realistically,
Maduro is not going to achieve that in Venezuela if he sticks to his
current course. So I ask, <em>who exactly is your unflinching, uncritical
&#8220;solidarity&#8221; helping?</em> And <em>if you can&#8217;t bring yourself to look
objectively at events happening thousands of miles away, how will you
do it in the struggle at&nbsp;home?</em></p>
