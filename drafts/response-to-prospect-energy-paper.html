            <p>There has been much talk of crisis in the energy sector in recent
months and this topic featured prominently at the 2021 Prospect Energy
Sector Conference. In December Prospect released a report on the
failing of the energy retail market along with suggestions of how to
fix it. Below I summarise the report and then provide my own&nbsp;analysis.</p>
<h2>Report&nbsp;Contents</h2>
<h3>The&nbsp;Problem</h3>
<p>The report details the massive reduction in the number of energy
retailers seen over the past year. It notes that this has eroded
public trust in energy suppliers and a levy will be added to people&#8217;s
bills to cover the cost of cleaning up after failed companies. It is
stated that &#8220;Prospect believes it is time to radically rethink our
whole approach to energy retail and accept that the idea of a market
for energy is largely a&nbsp;fiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Examining the failures of the existing model more closely, the report
notes the supply sector (the sale of electricity to consumers) has
relatively low profit margins. Most of the costs (and profits) are
accrued from energy production, transmission, and due to policy costs
(e.g., green energy levies). To make money, suppliers have relied on
overcharging customers that do not switch, in order to subsidise the
promotional rates offered to new customers. Many of the newer small
suppliers have actually operated at a loss. Customers that do not
switch suppliers overpay for energy, while those that do switch
underpay. The introduction of the energy price cap eliminated the
profit in the supply&nbsp;sector.</p>
<p>The recent surge in wholesale energy prices and the time-delay before
the energy price cap is updated to reflect this placed a financial
stress on suppliers. Ofgem had not been evaluating entrants to the
market to determine whether they could withstand these sorts of
shocks, meaning that many have now collapsed. Ofgem is currently
under-resourced to enforce any such rules were they to be
introduced. The report&nbsp;notes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since its inception the retail market has swung between two
extremes: it has either been an oligopoly of the Big Six,
characterised by excessive profits and weak incentives to treat
consumers well, or over-crowded and loss-making, with worsening
outcomes for consumers and retail staff. It is not at all clear that a
privatised, profit-seeking market structure can find a stable balance
between these two&nbsp;extremes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report also notes the increasing cost of energy as a share of the
household bills of the poorest decile and the failure to reduce energy
poverty substantially over the past 20 years. Another problem is the
squeeze on pay for workers at energy firms which has resulted from
competition in this market. Finally, lack of success in deploying
energy saving measures and smart meters in the drive for Net Zero is&nbsp;criticised.</p>
<h3>Proposed&nbsp;Solutions</h3>
<p>This report offers two policy measures. The first, and most dramatic,
is to place the supply of energy in &#8220;local public ownership&#8221;. It is
made clear that this would be a monopoly, with a single supplier
available in each region. They believe this would increase confidence
that a fair price is being charged and provide the reatilers with
greater stability. This would be coupled with giving local authorities
the responsibility and funding for the roll-out of energy efficiency&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>It is proposed that in England, groups of local authorities would own
region energy companies, while the devolved governments would own a
company for their territory. (Presumably this does not include
Northern Ireland, which is part of the Irish energy market and
governed under separate laws.) This scale would give &#8220;pricing power in
wholesale energy markets&#8221; and having fewer entities would make
regulatory oversight easier. It is also hoped that the long-term
contracts these suppliers could negotiate with generators would help
reduce wholesale market&nbsp;volatility.</p>
<p>The report notes the failure of recent council-owned energy suppliers
Robin Hood Energy and Bristol Energy. However, it is suggested that
these were primarily due to the way these suppliers had to behave in
the context of a competitive market and that the conditions for a
public monopoly would be fundamentally different. This experience
shows the &#8220;need to overhaul the current retail structure and create an
environment that allows providers driven by social objectives rather
than profit to&nbsp;thrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other proposal made in this report is &#8220;social energy tariff&#8221; which
would be made available to the poorest households. This would be
funded either by government or cross-subsidisation from other people&#8217;s
bills. Few details are given on how this would be implemented, but a
goal of keeping energy below 5% of household spending is&nbsp;suggested.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>This report has the unusual characteristic of being strong on many of
the specifics but weak on the overall message. They seem quite
distressed by the collapse of energy companies but don&#8217;t explain why
this is such a bad thing rather than just the inevitable result of
market forces. We are given quite a lot of facts but nowhere does
Prospect clearly lay out what is the central objection to current
arrangements. Buried amongst the details, I could pick out the
following&nbsp;criticisms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers are not paying a &#8220;fair&#8221; prices for&nbsp;energy.</li>
<li>The collapse of suppliers ultimately costs consumers&nbsp;money.</li>
<li>Workers at the energy suppliers are being&nbsp;squeezed.</li>
<li>The energy market has failed to reduce energy&nbsp;poverty.</li>
<li>The private energy suppliers have contributed to failing to achieve
  Net Zero&nbsp;goals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Considering the&nbsp;Objections</h3>
<p>I will take each of these in turn. First, nowhere are we told what
constitutes a &#8220;fair&#8221; price for energy. It would appear to be one which
reflects the wholesale costs of energy and its transmission. However,
no consideration is given as to where those costs arise from. It is
noted that most of the profits the energy sector are accrued in the
generation and network, but does not make any proposals for how to
rein these in (or even whether we should). They noted that many
customers (those that switch suppliers regularly) underpay for their
energy. Proposing that their costs go up will not be&nbsp;popular.</p>
<p>For all its focus on the collapse of energy supply companies, the
report does little to explain why this is a problem (given that no
one&#8217;s lights have gone out due to it). The only concrete issue they
note is that bills will increase (by £94 a year, according to
Citizen&#8217;s Advice) to cover the cost of dealing with this. While that
cost is certainly unwelcome, it pales in comparison to the £600
increase in the energy price cap that has been announced. To me this
seems like very much a secondary&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>The issue of pay for workers at energy suppliers is a more weighty one
and I have sympathy with it. However, the report associates this with
new entrants to the energy market and the energy price cap. Once
again, the implicit message that energy is too cheap is not one which
is likely to win Prospect many&nbsp;allies.</p>
<p>The arguments about the failure of the competitive market to reduce
energy poverty were extremely weak. A plot in the report shows that
energy poverty rates have in fact decreased marginally from 2003
to 2019 (although presumably will now be rising). This is not
an issue where the presence or absence of a competitive
retail market would be expected to have much bearing. The real problem
is one of wholesale costs, availability of well-payed jobs, and other
broader social&nbsp;factors.</p>
<p>The failure of various energy efficiency schemes are real and I don&#8217;t
doubt that the fragmented nature of the energy retail sector has made
them much more difficult to implement. However, I think it is somewhat
misleading to talk about this as a &#8220;failing on Net Zero&#8221;. By far the
most important aspect of our transition to Net Zero emissions is
changing how our energy is <em>produced</em>, something which the supply
companies have effectively no influence over. I think that the
privatised wholesale market in energy has been a major impediment to
this transition (for reasons I have detailed elsewhere) but the report
is not looking at this and, in fact, seems to propose that it would
continue in more-or-less its current&nbsp;form.</p>
<h3>Evaluating the&nbsp;Proposals</h3>
<p>The policy recommendations made in this paper would doubtless
represent an improvement on the status quo and I support any move that
will begin to reverse the privatisation of&nbsp;energy.</p>
<p>I felt the most positive aspect of these proposals is the endorsement of a
public <em>monopoly</em> in electricity supply. This goes further than
similar policies put forward by the Labour Party in previous elections
that there be local public suppliers competing in the market (a
position no seemingly abandoned&#8212;indeed, at the 2021 Prospect Energy
Sector Conference, Alan Whitehead <span class="caps">MP</span> claimed the party had never
endorsed any public ownership of energy suppliers despite it being
prominent in the 2017 manifesto). I thought the explanation of why
this could succeed where previous experiments in council-owned energy
companies have failed was a good one. Public monopolies would eliminate
wasteful duplication, ensure no one is penalised for loyalty, and
maximise public influence over the generators. Such monopolies are
expressly forbidden by <span class="caps">EU</span> energy regulations, however, and we would
need to carefully consult the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement to
determine whether such a policy would be permitted. It could also be
challenged on the basis of excluding European companies from the <span class="caps">UK</span>&nbsp;market.</p>
<p>I have long advocated that public electricity suppliers could play a
role around energy efficiency so endorse those suggestions here. This
could be done by reviving the electrical goods retailers which the old
nationalised electricity boards ran. These could sell or lease energy
efficient products at cost, or offer financing integrated with energy
bills. These companies could also take over the running of electric
vehicle charging points, again integrating payment with monthly energy
bills. Unfortunately, the proposals in this report seem somewhat
confused. At one point the report notes that it makes sense to offer
these through energy suppliers, as that is how consumers come into
contact with the energy sector. However, elsewhere it is recommended
that public supply companies operate at a regional level while
efficiency programs be devolved to local authorities. Perhaps one way
to resolve this would be to have local authorities effectively
operating a franchise of the regional&nbsp;company.</p>
<p>That being said, I am very skeptical of public ownership on a scale
where there is not a directly-elected body responsible for it. So,
while Scottish and Welsh government electricity companies could make
sense to me, I object to ownership by groups of English local
authorities. While the Welsh or the Scots could change some element of
the running of their companies by electing a government which pledged
to do so, coordinating that across dozens of local authorities,
elected on different cycles would be extremely difficult. As such, for
reasons of democratic control and accountability, I would advocate
either an energy company for all of England (accountable to
Westminster) or a separate one for each local authority. Of course,
were we to see the creation of regional governments in England, then
they could also be viable&nbsp;owners.</p>
<p>Where I am very critical of these proposals, however, is that they
seek to reform only the supply portion of the energy sector while
leaving everything else as it is now. The public suppliers would
continue to purchase electricity from private producers on a
competitive wholesale market. This is unlike the old electricity
boards which purchased electricity from the publicly-owned Central
Electricity Generating Board (in England and Whales&#8212;Scotland and
Northern Ireland had different arrangements). Also unlike the
electricity boards, these public suppliers would not own the
grid. They would, in effect, operate a billing system and a computer
to place bids on the wholesale market; nothing&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>This is insufficient to deal with the real problems at the heart of
the sector. The recent surge in wholesale prices was due to a reliance
on global gas markets (and thus swings in world demand), a lack of gas
storage, and an electricity generation mix that uses too much
gas. Changing the arrangements of energy suppliers won&#8217;t address any
of this and consumers would still be faced with rising bills. A system
somewhat like the one proposed has existed in the Canadian province of
Ontario since about 2000, with a competitive generating sector and
(mostly, albeit declining) public retailers.  As already noted, public
energy suppliers would also do little to combat profiteering in the
energy sector as a whole. However, this period has seen large
increases in electricity costs compared to the previous era of fully
public ownership. This report seemingly acknowledges these and it does
not make reducing energy prices a priority, except for the very&nbsp;poorest.</p>
<p>As already noted, the most element of reaching Net Zero emissions is
changing how we generate electricity. We&#8217;ll need
to generate a lot more of it, as various sectors are electrified. That
will require changes to other components of the energy sector than
retail. In particular, it will require large scale planning to ensure
successful integration of renewables, nuclear, and energy storage to
meet demand. This is something which a competitive energy market is
not well-suited for, as there is not guiding mind to oversee it. We
will also require massive long-term investments, which private owners
are generally loathed to do. Among the most successful
decarbonisation campaigns was the nuclear build-out in France during
the 1970s and 1980s, which was made possible by EDFs then-monopoly in
all aspects of the electricity sector. We should be arguing for a
similar public monopoly in this country, or to move in that
direction. At the very least, we need to do away with the liberalised
wholesale market and replace it with long-term power-supply contracts
with a national grid&nbsp;operator.</p>
<p>One might respond that this report is not ruling out changes to other
components of the electricity sector, it is just focusing on the
component which is currently in crisis. However, as I&#8217;ve already
shown, the extent to which this crisis impacts average people is
relatively minor (in comparison to other things affecting energy
prices). Moreover, the changes propsed here would be organisationally
difficult. Generator companies (or individual powerplants) could
straightforwardly be turned into public companies and run much as they
are now. The same applies for energy networks. However, the retail
companies are currently run on a national basis, supplying energy
throughout Great Britain. Nationalising them would be straightforward
enough, but breaking them up (or combining them) into local or
regional companies would be extremely difficult as they do not
currently have any regional basis. The alternative of creating the new
companies from scratch and then gradually transferring customers and
staff to these might work better but would still be complex and
time-consuming. My (subjective) feeling is that if you&#8217;re going to
make large and disruptive changes to the energy sector then you&#8217;d be
best off doing it all in one&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;m not particularly enthralled by the idea of the &#8220;social
tariff&#8221;. The real problem here is not energy poverty but just poverty
full-stop. We should be looking to make changes to the welfare state
to address that. Of secondary importance is the issue of
poorly-insulated homes (best addressed through housing policy) and
high energy prices for <em>everyone</em>. A social tariff is a program that
will benefit only a few people and therefore generate little popular
support to push for its implementation. Perhaps instead we should
consider something along the lines of covering energy network costs
out of general taxation (thus paid progressively based on income) or
making initial units of energy available at low cost but then stepping
up the cost for high&nbsp;users.</p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>This report, like much talk about energy policy in the past several
years, has been focused almost entirely on the supply sector, despite
the fact that it is not the fundamental source of dysfunction. The
biggest problems in the energy sector all stem from the fact that
generation and transmission are owned by a fragmented profit-seeking
companies with short investment-horizons and no guiding-mind
responsible for the system as a&nbsp;whole.</p>
<p>As I have hinted above, I believe that we need to see the return of a
single public company responsible for energy production and
distribution in Great Britain, along the lines of the old Central
Electricity Generating Board. It could then sell to regional retail
companies, from which households would purchase energy, but given the
existing retailers are not organised on a regional basis I do not
think it would be worth the difficulty of creating such
companies. Instead we should seek to bring at least following into
public&nbsp;ownership:</p>
<ul>
<li>All renewable energy&nbsp;generators</li>
<li>Electricity storage&nbsp;facilities</li>
<li>Sizewell B nuclear power plant (the only one with significant life&nbsp;remaining)</li>
<li>All nuclear power plants currently under construction, once&nbsp;completed</li>
<li>The electricity networks (transmission and&nbsp;distribution)</li>
<li>The gas&nbsp;networks</li>
<li>Remaining gas storage&nbsp;facilities</li>
<li>All energy supply&nbsp;companies</li>
</ul>
<p>It would probably make sense to bring at least some gas power plants
into public ownership as well, as they&#8217;ll likely be needed for some
time yet. The above assets would be merged into a single national
company (or perhaps two companies: one for electricity, one for
gas). The wholesale market in electricity and gas would be ended,
replaced with long-term contracts between the nationalised company and
remaining private producers. The new companies would be required to
develop a multi-decade plan for meeting Net Zero targets, with new
infrastructure publicly-owned wherever possible.  The provision of
energy efficiency measures could be done in partnership between the
utility and local authorities, perhaps using a franchise model. Ending
the energy market and returning to a vertically-integrated
nationalised utility would doubtless be an extended and complicated
process. However, the experience of the Canadian province of New
Brunswick, which did just that ten years ago, shows that it is&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Over time, the move away from volatile global gas markets towards
greener energy, the ability to borrow at public-sector interest rates,
and economies of scale can be expected to stabilise and reduce energy
costs for everyone. However, to gain public support for such an
ambitious program we should also look to offer more immediate
relief. Reduced corporate profits can help to reduce energy
prices. Given that everyone has to pay a flat rate for the energy
networks, this amounts to a regressive tax and there would be a strong
argument to fund it out of general taxation instead (with fees
remaining for second homes and commercial customers). As already
mentioned, some sort of progressive tariff (with costs per unit of
energy rising with use) could also be worth&nbsp;considering.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As the part of the energy sector which is most visible to consumers,
the energy retail companies receive a disproportionate amount of
attention in discussions. However, as I hope this essay has
demonstrated, they are really the least important component of the
sector and the real issues lie elsewhere. While Prospect&#8217;s proposals
would be an improvement on the status quo and the support for public
monopoly is a significant step forward, they do not address the
pathology at the heart of a privatised energy&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>Though Prospect describes real problems in the energy sector, it
skipped over many others. Its central critique of a competitive market
in energy suppliers is that it has lead either to a price-gouging
oligopoly or to a proliferation of small companies which sell energy
below its true cost and squeeze workers&#8217; wages. Problems of high
prices are only acknowledged inasmuch as they affect the poorest,
despite all households facing significant increases. Higher prices and
failures to meet targets on the way to meet Net Zero are fundamentally
issues of energy <em>production</em> and, to a lesser extent,
<em>distribution</em>. Any attempt to fix energy must be centred on&nbsp;that.</p>
