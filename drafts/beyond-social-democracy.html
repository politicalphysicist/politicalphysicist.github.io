            <p>Is Labour a socialist party? At first glance, this appears to be a
silly question; it says it is right in the constitution. The leader and
shadow chancellor routinely refer to it as such. These day it seems
like everyone from every wing of the party are enthusiastically using
the&nbsp;word.</p>
<p>But are we all using it to mean the same thing? For me, socialism has
always referred to a non-capitalist society in which production occurs
to meet human need, the means of production (and distribution and
exchange) are in common ownership, and democracy is extended to the
running of the economy. In that case, to say that you are a socialist
would mean orienting oneself towards that as, at least, a long-term
goal. What socialism does not mean to me is an attempt to make a more
humane form of&nbsp;capitalism.</p>
<p>Looking at the 2017 Labour manifesto, I saw precious little which I
could call socialist. While it may have seemed radical in today&#8217;s
context, in historical terms it was calling for only a (rather tepid)
social democracy. To the extent which it contained a coherent economic
strategy, the focus was on using state resources to help back
technological development which will lead to future growth in the
private sector. Commitments on public ownership covered only a
fraction of what Thatcher privatised and fall well within
international&nbsp;norms.</p>
<p>For those of us in the Labour Party that are socialists, in the sense
I defined above, I think we need to be very honest about what the
manifesto was: a sort of left-social democracy, at most. This is
something which can clearly win large-scale public support, which
socialism can not (as yet). We&#8217;ve seen similar developments in
other countries such as Greece with Syriza and the <span class="caps">US</span> with&nbsp;Sanders.</p>
<h3>Learning from&nbsp;History</h3>
<p>Is this a problem? Am I simply insisting on ideological purity,
distracting from the good polices in the manifesto by demanding we
think about some hypothetical better future system? My sense is that
this is a common attitude among many socialists within Labour. These
people are desire socialism based on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_socialism">ethical</a>
arguments. From that perspective, socialism is something which is
&#8220;nice to have&#8221;, but which we can always work for later. However, if
our desire for socialism stems from an understanding of the workings
and contradictions of capitalism, which social democracy is unable to
resolve, then things start to show up under a different light. Capital
will resist social democracy as not in its class interests, while
policies such as full employment tend to cause crises in
capitalism. Thus, the transition to socialism will be vital if only to
retain the gains of social&nbsp;democracy.</p>
<p>We saw this in the past. Social democracy had its heyday from the end
of World War <span class="caps">II</span> until the 1970s. However, by then full employment had
led to a confident working class who were making demands which
undermined profits. This, along with some other economic issues such
as the Oil Shock, led investment to dry up despite Keynesian
ministrations, while inflation soared. These problems in the
capitalist economy resulted in less tax revenue for governments,
undermining their ability to administer the welfare&nbsp;state.</p>
<p>A number of leftists within the traditional social democratic parties
saw that broader public control over the economy and investment was
needed to overcome this crisis without losing the gains for workers
resulting from the Post-War settlement. In Sweden the Meidner Plan
proposed to gradually socialise all medium and large companies, while
in Britain Tony Benn argued for increased public ownership and
planning (with the involvement of workers) in order to modernise the
economy. Ultimately, all such attempts to radicalise social democracy
failed and instead the crisis was resolved through&nbsp;Thatcherism.</p>
<p>Knowing this, what should the strategy of socialists be today to avoid
repeating this fate? I&#8217;ve seen a few different approaches put
forward. One is to push for social democratic reforms and, once this
new cycle of social democracy runs into crisis again, then take the
opportunity to take up the arguments of Meidner and Benn once again. A
variation on this approach assumes that under current conditions
social democracy would cause a crisis almost immediately and the
movement will thus be forced to push towards socialism in short
order. Finally, some feel that we should embrace socialism now,
supporting social democratic reforms when the opportunity arises but
clearly indicating that once reaching power we will take a more
radical approach. Obviously, these represent points on a continuum and
many people may feel they fall in between these&nbsp;categories.</p>
<h3>The Long&nbsp;Game</h3>
<p>Probably the most common strategy is to support left-social democracy
for now, as this is all that is felt practical. There may be different
reasons for this. Perhaps it is felt that socialism will require
action on a continental scale and until the forces for it are mature
in a larger number of countries we&#8217;ll have to wait. I remain
unconvinced by this argument, but I&#8217;ll put that aside for
now. Alternatively, perhaps it is felt that you will only be able to
get popular support for a left social democracy and not for
socialism. This, unfortunately, is more&nbsp;convincing.</p>
<p>Jacobin Magazine is one of the most prominent champions of this
approach (or at least the editorial team is&#8212;contributors are varied
enough that you do get dissenting articles from time to time). They
point to the popularity of campaigns like Medicare for All (this being
an American magazine) and suggest that winning these sorts of reforms
will build working class confidence to demand more. Over time this
will allow proper socialism to make its way onto the agenda. They
point out that something like the Meidner Plan was only able to get
any traction after 30 years of the Swedish welfare state.
It&#8217;s important to note that this is distinct from Bernstein-style
reformism. The argument here is <em>not</em> that successive incremental
reforms will, eventually, add up to socialism. Instead it is that
these incremental reforms will allow politics to radicalise so that
eventually a more significant rupture can be demanded, perhaps as a
response to a crisis in the rebuilt welfare state. This also provides
time for the left to build its forces and capacities to the point
where such a rupture could conceivably&nbsp;succeed.</p>
<p>The most obvious problem with this strategy is that attempts at such
ruptures didn&#8217;t work last time around. The Left was not strong enough
in the 1970s to even win the argument on the need to <em>try</em> to move
beyond capitalism. We&#8217;d need some sort of plan to give ourselves a
better chance at winning this time, but I&#8217;ve never heard this
explained. And what if we do fail again? Will we have to wait through
another cycle of neoliberalism to give the whole process a third&nbsp;try?</p>
<p><em>I want to&nbsp;say:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Need to be clear on limits of&nbsp;manifesto</li>
<li>Need to have some idea of how social democracy failed in&nbsp;past</li>
<li>How long can it work for this&nbsp;time?</li>
<li>Want to know how to get past it this time<ul>
<li>Replay last time and push for more once crisis? But if not
  arguing for socialism now, why do we expect it to go any&nbsp;differently?</li>
<li>Immediately push further once initial crisis hits? But people
  won&#8217;t be&nbsp;prepared.</li>
<li>Implement radical social democracy which is less limiting? Will
  there be time? Will be pushback and must be able to justify why
  these forms&nbsp;necessary.</li>
<li>Argue for more straight away? Party can&#8217;t get elected on this&nbsp;(yet).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can we argue for more now?<ul>
<li>Be in separate&nbsp;party?</li>
<li>Get main workers&#8217; party to argue&nbsp;it?</li>
<li>Be a vocal left within main workers&#8217;&nbsp;party?</li>
<li><strong>Push for debate about fundamental understanding of society,
  power&nbsp;structures</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most people in party thinking in terms of immediate reforms
  (including on the&nbsp;left)</li>
<li>Those on left largely remaining based on ethical socialism, so seen
  more like something we can do any&nbsp;time.</li>
<li>Need to get whole party thinking about what are limits of social
  democracy, understand arguments for going beyond&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Where do Alternative Models of Ownership fit in here? At least get
  people talking, but still not thinking in terms of capitalism&#8217;s
  contradictions&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li>Clause <span class="caps">IV</span> debate? Imperfect, but best opportunity I can see at the&nbsp;moment.</li>
