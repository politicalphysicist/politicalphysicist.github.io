        <section class="article">
            <p>In electricity, the trend across the world has been towards
liberalisation and privatisation. While these two are not synonymous
(you can have a liberalised system consisting entirely of
publicly-owned entities or a privatised, vertically-integrated
monopoly), one tends to lead to the other. Even if public ownership
persists in a liberalised system, it tends to encourage
decision-making to be similar to that of a private business and
inhibits the long-term planning which the sector demands. For these
reasons, I have argued that the Labour Party must go beyond its
current vague policies on public ownership in energy and commit to a
complete abolition of the liberalised electricity&nbsp;market.</p>
<p>However, one is quickly left wondering how to achieve this and what
its replacement would look like. There is plenty of historical
experience in transitioning to liberalised energy markets, for which
Britain acts as the original template. However, to my knowledge, only
one jurisdiction has ever de-liberalised electricity: the small
Canadian province of New Brunswick (incidentally, where I grew&nbsp;up).</p>
<h2>The&nbsp;Background</h2>
<p>New Brunswick is located on the east coast of Canada, between Nova
Scotia and Quebec, and just above the <span class="caps">US</span> state of
Maine. Geographically it is about the same size as Scotland, but it
has a population of only 700&nbsp;000. It is home to a number of
energy-intensive heavy industries (although these have declined
somewhat in recent years) and is a net electricity exporter to other
provinces and the United&nbsp;States.</p>
<p>The main utility, <span class="caps">NB</span> Power, was created by the provincial
government in 1920 as a &#8220;Crown corporation&#8221; (the Canadian term for a
nationalised industry). It came to own almost all of the province&#8217;s
electrical infrastructure (with the exception of 3 municipalities
which operate their own distribution grids). In the early 2000s,
however, concern grew over the level of debt which it held. Some of
this was due to the Point LePreau nuclear generating station, the
construction of which had gone over-budget in the 70s, and a botched
deal with the Venezuelan government to purchase a fuel known as
Orimulsion, which they ceased to produce after the attempted coup
against Chavez. Another key factor was the political pressure to keep
rates low and political direction to undertake various infrastructure
projects, regardless of whether they made economic&nbsp;sense.</p>
<h2>Neoliberal&nbsp;Power</h2>
<p>This led the Progressive Conservative government to restructure the
corporation, creating the following entities splitting the utility
into the following&nbsp;parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nuclear, operating Point LePreau and any hypothetical future nuclear
  power&nbsp;plants</li>
<li>Generation, owning all non-nuclear generating assets (one of the
  largest thermal power stations was later split off into its own&nbsp;company)</li>
<li>Transmission, owning and maintaining the high-voltage transmission&nbsp;grid</li>
<li>Distribution and Customer Service, responsible for the low-voltage
distribution grid and billing&nbsp;customers</li>
<li><span class="caps">NB</span> Power Holding Corporation, a holding company for the above&nbsp;corporations</li>
<li>System Operator, directing the operation of the transmission grid
  (along with those in a couple of small adjacent&nbsp;jurisdictions)</li>
<li>Electric Finance Corporation, which managed some portions of the
  debt held by the other&nbsp;companies</li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of Nuclear and Finance, these enterprises were not
considered &#8220;agents of the Crown&#8221; or Crown corporations in the usual
sense. In effect, they were private corporations in which the
provincial government was the sole shareholder. Furthermore, the
System Operator was an independent entity which was meant to ensure
&#8220;efficient operation of a competitive market&#8221; in electricity. Distribution
(and the municipal distributors) did not necessarily have to purchase
electricity from the Nuclear or Generation companies, opening the door
to private generators or imports from other&nbsp;jurisdictions.</p>
<p>With their decrease in public control, emphasis on competition, and
reliance on market mechanisms, these changes were undeniably
neoliberal. That said, they still represented fairly mild reform of
electricity by international standards. No assets were privatised and as
New Brunswick already had a surplus of generation capacity there was
little room for the expansion of private generators (although a few
small ones did spring up). While the wording of the legislation leaves
it unclear to me if there remained an official monopoly in electricity
supply, in practice this was the case. Finally, energy remained an
inherently political topic, with the government retaining the ability
to veto rate increases (albeit, this amounted to over-ruling the
independent regulatory body, rather than the power company) and take a
stance on infrastructure&nbsp;investment.</p>
<h2>A Change of&nbsp;Direction</h2>
<p>This arrangement persisted for 10 years, marred only be an unpopular
and ultimately unsuccessful attempt by a Liberal government to sell
the group of companies to Hydro Quebec (the Crown utility in our
neighbouring province). However, the fact was that the setup was a poor one
not only from an ideological perspective, but from a business one as
well. A market the size of New Brunswick could not support any
meaningful competition, so all that the splitting up of the sector had
done was to lead to inefficiency. In 2013, a new Progressive
Conservative government decided to reverse course and restore <span class="caps">NB</span> Power
as a vertically integrated Crown&nbsp;corporation.</p>
<p>The entire set of companies listed above was merged back into New
Brunswick Power Corporation (<span class="caps">NBP</span>). It had an explicit monopoly in the
sale of electricity to municipal suppliers and all other customers
and was the only entity allowed to build new transmission
infrastructure. It was not bound by the usual obligations of a
corporation, but instead to meet the&nbsp;policy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a)  that the rates charged by the Corporation for sales of electricity within the Province
( i) should be established on the basis of annually forecasted costs for the supply, transmission and distribution of the electricity, and
( ii) should provide sufficient revenue to the Corporation to permit it to earn a just and reasonable return, in the context of the Corporation’s objective to earn sufficient income to achieve a capital structure of at least 20% equity,
(b)  that all the Corporation’s sources and facilities for the supply, transmission and distribution of electricity within the Province should be managed and operated in a manner that is consistent with reliable, safe and economically sustainable service and that will
( i) result in the most efficient supply, transmission and distribution of electricity,
( ii) result in consumers in the Province having equitable access to a secure supply of electricity, and
( iii) result in the lowest cost of service to consumers in the Province, and
(c)  that, consistent with the policy objectives set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) and to the extent practicable, rates charged by the Corporation for sales of electricity within the Province shall be maintained as low as possible and changes in rates shall be stable and predictable from year to&nbsp;year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">NB</span> Power was once again an agent of the Crown, unquestionably an arm
of the government. It was accountable to the Cabinet, who could veto
many key decisions and request the board of directors take various
actions (although the board had the right to say no). On a day-to-day
basis oversight was provided by the Energy and Utilities Board (<span class="caps">EUB</span>),
the province&#8217;s independent regulator, which had to approve all rate
increases, large capital expenditures, and long-term business&nbsp;plans.</p>
<p>Integrated Resource Plans (IRPs) must be submitted to cabinet and the
<span class="caps">EUB</span> at least every three years, forecasting at least 20 years into the
future (the most recent one looked 25 years ahead). An <span class="caps">IRP</span> consists of
projections of electricity demand, stakeholder consultation, a survey
of existing infrastructure, expected retirement dates of existing
infrastructure, and a plan for any new infrastructure which will be
needed. The level of detail will, of course, become increasingly
general the further into the future one looks. The most recent <span class="caps">IRP</span>,
for example, explains how short-term changes in demand will be met by
a modest expansion in renewable capacity and aggressive pushing of
efficiency and demand-management measures. In the mid-term it looked
at expanding existing hydro facilities and considered a few options
for replacing some of the larger generators when they retire,
indicating by what date decisions will have to be&nbsp;made.</p>
<p>While New Brunswick never privatised electricity and had only a
minimally competitive market, as the only jurisdiction (as far as I
know) to have reversed course de-liberalised the sector it is worthy
of attention. This action was not undertaken by a socialist, or even
social democratic, government and in no way represents a blueprint for
the <span class="caps">UK</span> to follow. However, there are certainly aspects we should
emulate and many lessons to be&nbsp;learned.</p>
<h2>Winding Down the&nbsp;Market</h2>
<p>While the 2003 Electricity Act talks extensively about developing a
market, the concept makes no appearance in the 2013 version. The
System Operator was merged back into <span class="caps">NBP</span>&#8217;s transmission division and
there was not even a pretence of independence. The electricity market
was gone and a planned, integrated electricity system was&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>This represents an important lesson: it tells us that it is entirely
possible to reverse the liberalisation of electricity and that
expertise exists which knows how to do so. It also demonstrates the
necessary legal framework needed to achieve this, including
transitional measures. While this may seem like technical
obscurantism, having such an example to point to will be useful when
developing legislation, particularly if the civil service is claiming
it can&#8217;t be&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important is what this tells us how to restore a
nationalised electricity system when those around remain
privatised. Selling electricity into the liberalised American grid is
important to New Brunswick and no restructuring would succeed unless
this ability was retained. Similarly, when negotiating its way out of
the <span class="caps">EU</span>&#8217;s liberalisation directives in electricity, the <span class="caps">UK</span> will need
some way to continue interacting with the European electricity market
and to keep Ireland connected to the&nbsp;continent.</p>
<p>The model adopted in New Brunswick, and which I see no technical
reason could not be used here, is to establish what&#8217;s referred to as
an &#8220;Open Access Transmission Tariff&#8221;. The details of this are
extremely technical, but in short it provides a set of rules governing
under what conditions and for what price <span class="caps">NBP</span> will transmit another
utility&#8217;s electricity through its grid, on a non-discriminatory
basis. This was necessary in order to meet <span class="caps">US</span> government requirements
for interconnections. It allows other jurisdictions to use the <span class="caps">NBP</span>
grid as an intermediate step when selling to each other (for example,
allowing Nova Scotia to buy electricity from Quebec).  Such an
arrangement also allows <span class="caps">NBP</span> to engage in trade via its subsidiary, the
New Brunswick Electricity Marketing Corporation. This was
formed from the rump of the old Generation company, after its assets
were transferred back to <span class="caps">NBP</span>, and acts as an agent to export surplus
electricity or purchase imports when doing so is cheaper than
generating it&nbsp;in-province.</p>
<p>While such a setup allows slightly more of a market to persist than I
would prefer, it does not prevent a public monopoly in supply and
still allows the public utility to engage in long-term
planning. Realistically, such an approach will be necessary if autarky
is to be avoided, at least while liberalised electricity markets
persist in other jurisdictions. In the British context, it would allow
Ireland to easily interconnect and engage in trade with the European
electricity market, while retaining access for the <span class="caps">UK</span>.</p>
<h2>Ownership and&nbsp;Control</h2>
<p>There is much to admire about New Brunswick&#8217;s Electricity Act. It
promises to better deliver for the public good than the preceding
system and to be more accountable. However, it was put in place by a
bourgeois government and its goals were in no way socialist. Thus we
see the old &#8220;top-down&#8221; model of nationalisation&nbsp;pursued.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">NBP</span> board of directors is entirely appointed by cabinet and &#8220;shall
administer the business and affairs of the Corporation on a commercial
basis, taking into consideration government policy.&#8221; There is no scope
for industrial democracy or workers&#8217; plans for production. Board
appointments are meant to be made on technical merit, rather than
political considerations. This was to avoid so-called political
&#8220;patronage&#8221;, which is certainly a worthwhile goal, but the move
towards technocratic managerialism brings its own problems. The risk
is that this will tend to ignore the inherently political nature of
decision-making in energy&nbsp;policy.</p>
<p>We also see this in the degree of independence from cabinet that <span class="caps">NB</span>
Power now has, with the energy minister no longer being able to
unilaterally direct its operations. To some extent this is
understandable; historical experience in the province has shown
governments imposing questionable projects leading to increased debt
and higher rates. Still, one has to wonder if, in an effort to avoid
ill-considered pet projects and petty political interference, the
notion of democratic control has been&nbsp;lost.</p>
<h2>Grandfathering&nbsp;Neoliberalism</h2>
<p>The Act could also have gone further at unwinding the trend towards
privatisation. While <span class="caps">NBP</span> is the only organisation allowed to
operate a transmission grid and is the only entity allowed to build
new transmission infrastructure, any existing privately-owned
infrastructure is allowed to continue operation. This represents only
a small portion of transmission assets but is still an unsatisfactory
approach. <span class="caps">NBP</span> is also permitted to engage in partnerships
(potentially with private companies) when it builds new transmission
infrastructure. Additionally, the municipal suppliers are allowed to
continue any power-purchasing contracts from other generators which
existed when the act was signed and can continue to renew them for as
long as they&nbsp;wish.</p>
<p>Less objectionable but potentially still a cause for concern is the
clause which permits municipal suppliers to purchase electricity
generated within their jurisdiction. This appears to have been meant
primarily to allow feed-in tariffs and other such mechanisms to
support distributed generation. This is probably well-intended, but
should nonetheless be approached with caution as feed-in tariffs often
end up benefiting the well-to-do while resulting in more expensive
electricity for everyone else. Moreover, this provision opens the door
for the municipal utilities to acquire electricity from local private
generators, although to date this has not&nbsp;occurred.</p>
<p>Indeed, the existence of private generators and private ownership is
not fundamentally objected to in this Act. Nowhere is it specified
that generation must be publicly owned and what private generation
infrastructure had been built continues to sell to <span class="caps">NB</span> Power as
before. This has mainly taken the form of wind farms and a mid-sized
gas power plant. A number of small private renewable installations
(some &#8220;community owned&#8221;) also exist. Concerningly, one of the wind
farms has recently been allowed to expand without any public stake
being taken. This is especially odd, as <span class="caps">NBP</span>&#8217;s most recent
Integrated Resource Plan noted that private investment results in
significantly more expensive electricity than public, especially from
renewable sources. It is to be hoped that, knowing this, the Corporation
will prefer to build in-house in&nbsp;future.</p>
<h2>Oversight or&nbsp;Obstruction?</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the <span class="caps">EUB</span> oversees the operations of <span class="caps">NBP</span>. I
must grant approval of the Integrated Resource Plans, rate increases,
and new investment. It&#8217;s overriding goal when doing this is to ensure
the lowest possible rates consistent with the company remaining
financially viable. When making its decisions the <span class="caps">EUB</span> consults
with experts, questions representatives of <span class="caps">NBP</span>, and solicits feedback
from industry and&nbsp;individuals.</p>
<p>Providing oversight is a good thing. It means that there are
additional people double-checking calculations and
assumptions. However, there are things to beware of in the <span class="caps">EUB</span>&#8217;s
approach. First of all, large industries are much better able to make
themselves heard in such a process than disorganised household
consumers. More importantly, the mandate which the <span class="caps">EUB</span> is meant to
pursue appears to be overly&nbsp;restrictive.</p>
<h2>Stability, Risk, and&nbsp;Innovation</h2>
<p>Solar</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is, however, a decrease to energy sales revenue which is higher
than the decrease to the system cost.  What this means is that the
current net- metering program is not sending the correct price signal
to customers looking for alternative electricity choices, and that
large penetrations of solar <span class="caps">PV</span> will result in higher costs being borne
by customers without solar <span class="caps">PV</span>. It will be important that <span class="caps">NB</span> Power
continue to monitor this trend and evaluate the appropriate business
model that provides appropriate price signals to&nbsp;customers.</p>
</blockquote>
