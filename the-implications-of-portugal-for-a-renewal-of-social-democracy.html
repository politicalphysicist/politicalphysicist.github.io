            <p>For some time I’ve been curious about what’s been happening with of
the Left-supported social democratic government in Portugal. It struck
me as the best argument against my suspicion that there isn’t room for
a classical social democratic policy anymore. This was brought to the
fore yesterday when a Portuguese member of the Labour Party in Oxford
posted a link to the local Momentum Facebook group to a pamphlet
called
<a href="http://www.feps-europe.eu/assets/8fe67afb-3ddd-4ccf-b35e-baa2ece549df/book-portugal-dec2017-web-pppdf.pdf"><em>The Portuguese Government Solution: The “Fourth Way” to Social-Democratic Politics?</em></a>. This
was produced by a European social democratic think-tank
(<span class="caps">FEPS</span>—Foundation for European Progressive Studies) looking at the
model provided by the Socialist Party government in Portugal and
suggesting this shows “that there is a way for these parties to
reaffirm a left-wing agenda within the <span class="caps">EU</span>”.</p>
<figure><img alt="Catarina Martins and prime minister António Costa, leaders of the radical leftPortuguese party Bloco de Esquerda and the social democratic Socialist Party, respectively." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/Catarina-Martins-e-António-Costa.jpg"/><figcaption>Catarina Martins and prime minister António Costa, leaders of the radical leftPortuguese party Bloco de Esquerda and the social democratic Socialist Party, respectively.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The document explains how in 2015 the right wing government which had
been pursuing fierce austerity lost its overall majority in parliament
(while still remaining the largest party). The Socialist Party (<span class="caps">PS</span>)
chose not to support them or to enter a grand coalition, instead
opting to form a minority government with the support of the radical
Bloco de Esquerda (Left Bloc) and the orthodox Communist Party of
Portugal (as well as the latter’s close allies, the Greens). While
there were large areas of disagreement between these parties, they
were able to form a set of mutually agreed policy which reversed
course on austerity while respecting <span class="caps">EU</span> rules. Representatives of <span class="caps">PS</span>
say that this was largely consistent with what they had run on, except
with the implementation of some policies accelerated. They have since
celebrated the success of this government, claiming it has functioned
far more smoothly than anyone expected and that the economy has
started growing again while the deficit has fallen to within
<span class="caps">EU</span>-sanctioned levels. The government is popular, with support for <span class="caps">PS</span>
growing significantly and staying relatively stable for the juniour partners.</p>
<p>I had read a fair bit about the situation in Portugal when this
government was formed in late 2015, but had not heard much
since. Nonetheless, much what I was reading ran counter to the more
critical line I remembered coming from members of Bloco
at the time. As
such, I read the report with a great deal of scepticism. One thing
which I noticed, in particular, was how modest most of the measures
enacted by the government were. By and large, they were simply
reversing some of the worst policies of the previous government, doing
little to actually implement new progressive policy. Personally, I
would question whether that really amounts to a repudiation of the
Third Way and a return to social democracy’s roots.</p>
<p>I was very interested to hear Bloco’s side of the story. I started by
rereading some of the
<a href="(https://jacobinmag.com/2015/11/bloco-esquerda-portugal-silva-ps-pcp-be-austerity-merkel-troika)">material produced in 2015</a>. These
contradcited on a number of assertions made by the <span class="caps">FEPS</span> report,
starting with the idea that the <span class="caps">PS</span> had campaigned on ending
austerity. On the contrary, Bloco members claimed that <span class="caps">PS</span> had run a
contradictory campaign and ran on policies similar to those of their
right wing opponents. As such, it was
<a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/10/left-bloc-portugal-austerity-social-democracy">initially expected</a>
that they would support a minority right wing government. In fact, it
seems to be a running theme that Bloco was overly pessimistic about
the prospects for a left government. They didn’t expect <span class="caps">PS</span> to be
interested in trying to build one, then they didn’t expect <span class="caps">PS</span> to agree
to their demands, and then they assumed that fulfilling even these
modest demands would quickly require defying <span class="caps">EU</span> budgetary rules and
collapse the government. In all of this they have proven to be wrong.</p>
<p>What I really wanted to learn, though, was how the situation had
progressed since then. Unfortunately, much of the international
left-wing websites are very good about reporting on developments when
something exciting like an election happen, while very bad at letting
us know what actually comes of those events. After a bit of digging I
found an
<a href="https://www.freitag.de/autoren/der-freitag/die-austeritaet-ist-eine-grosse-luege">interview with Bloco’s leader</a>,
Catarina Martins, from sometime last year. While published in German,
Google Translate proved sufficiently advanced for me to get a good grasp
of the interview. It is clear that Martins views the government’s
achievements as extremely limited. She points out that most of what it
has done has simply been to stop the implementation of new austerity
and reverse some of what had already been applied, as I noted
earlier. She does not consider Portugal to have a left government, as
government inaction has been woefully inadequate to address the deep
problems facing the country.</p>
<p>This was an interesting corrective, but didn’t provide the deep level
of analysis I was looking for to contrast with the <em>The Portuguese
Government Solution</em>. After some rooting around on the
<a href="https://www.rosalux.de/en/">Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung</a> website, I
eventually found an English-language report written by Bloco and Die
Linke activist Catarina Príncipe (whom I hold in high regard as a
leftist commentator). This report, titled
<a href="https://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/sonst_publikationen/Politics_of_Toleration_Portugal.pdf"><em>Anti-Austerity and the Politics of Toleration in Portugal: A way for the Radical Left to develop a transformative project?</em></a>
explains the government experience from Bloco’s point of view; indeed,
although I am not certain of this, possibly from the perspective of
someone on the left of Bloco.</p>
<p>This report provides background on the pre-2015 political situation in
Portugal which complements that of <span class="caps">FEPS</span>. Once again, Príncipe
emphasised how Bloco had not expected a deal to be reached to support
a <span class="caps">PS</span> government. As such, they were on the back foot during
negotiations from the start. Where the <span class="caps">PS</span> spoke of many policies as
though they had always supported, this report indicates that in fact
they were pushed by Bloco and the Communists against great
resistence. While the government has introduced some progressive
measures, it was pointed out that Bloco has not been completely
successful in preventing new privatisation, particularly of banks
which were bailed out by the state at massive cost to the public
purse. While not stated outright, my reading suggests that <span class="caps">EU</span> pressure
contributed to those privatisations. It is noted that the <span class="caps">EU</span> demanded
new cuts in some areas to offset increased social spending, while <span class="caps">NATO</span>
insisted on an increase in the military budget.</p>
<p>Príncipe also present a considerably less optimistic view of the state
of the economy in Portugal. She points out that while the revival is
partially due to citizens now having more spending power, it is also
heavily dependent on external factors such as an increase in tourism
and the low price of oil. Crucially, it is the result of unused
economic capacity being utilised once again and not of new
investment. In
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/chapo-trap-house/episode-132-blocos-modern-life-81217">an interview</a>
(starts at 24:56)
she says that public investment is extremely low, with the funds
instead being used for increases in current expenditure. Likewise,
there has been little investment in the private sector. This
contradicts claims made in the <span class="caps">FEPS</span> report, although some of their
investment figures are only in terms of year-on-year percent
increases, which could simply be hiding a very low starting
point. Príncipe feels that the lack of investment and precarious state
of the financial sector leaves Portugal’s economy vulnerable. Should
there be a new downturn or crisis, she predicts that the <span class="caps">PS</span> and the <span class="caps">EU</span>
will quickly insist on the return to austerity in order to balance budgets.</p>
<p>The report ends with an assessment of Bloco’s strategy, as well as
some notes on the relation of the Left to the <span class="caps">EU</span>. While acknowledging
that Bloco had little choice but to support the <span class="caps">PS</span> government,
Príncipe is clearly uncomfortable with parts of the direction her
party has taken. At times this comes across quite clearly in the
above-mentioned interview. She suggests ways in which the party must
be reoriented away from an overly parliamentary focus and seek to
build the capacity to fully challenge austerity and even capitalism.</p>
<p>There are some areas of clear contradiction between the two accounts,
particularly around the <span class="caps">PS</span>’s electoral campaign and levels of
investment in the Portuguese economy. Not being able to read
Portuguese, I’m unable to properly assess who is correct in these
areas. Overall, however, I find Príncipe’s account of the situation to
be the more convincing one.</p>
<p>So, what are the consequences for a Labour government trying to
implement something like the
<a href="https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/">2017 election manifesto</a> in the <span class="caps">UK</span>?
That manifesto was, after-all, essentially just a return to mild
social democracy (although John McDonnell’s
<a href="https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Alternative-Models-of-Ownership.pdf">Alternative Models of Ownership</a>
report starts to point in some more radical directions). In one
regard, at least, Labour will have it easier: even in the <span class="caps">EU</span>, the <span class="caps">UK</span>
retains more control of its monetary and fiscal policy than Portugal
by virtue of not being in the Euro. On the other hand, there are a
number of difficulties. For one, the <span class="caps">PS</span> has implemented this program
with Bloco and the Communists in parliament holding their feet to the
fire. Labour would have no such anti-capitalist left force keeping
them accountable. On the contrary, they would have a rump of
right-wing MPs who may well defy party discipline and vote against
even mildly progressive measures. What’s more, the <span class="caps">PS</span> remains very
much an establishment party whose leaders are trusted by Portuguese
and European capital. The same can not be said of the current Labour leadership.</p>
<p>Labour’s program would also go considerably further than what has been
done in Portugal, to include much greater increases in social spending
and some nationalisation. These measures are more likely to antagonise
capital, with the <span class="caps">CBI</span>
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/labour-nationalisation-hard-brexit-cbi-president-paul-dreschler-a8252136.html">already denouncing</a>
the latter and claiming they would deter investment. Perhaps this is
just an empty threat (there was plenty of such rhetoric during the
formation of the <span class="caps">PS</span> government), but perhaps not. British capital is
very powerful, after all, and has often defeated measures which its
European counterparts accommodated themselves to. The fact that the
British economy is so depending on the City of London’s status as the
global financial hub may also constrain a future Labour government.</p>
<p>But most of all, we must remember how vulnerable the Portuguese
government is. If Príncipe is to be believed, the economic recovery
has been contingent on factors outside of their control. Should the
economy sour, the entire project of “turning the page on
austerity” would be at risk. What if there is a recession in the <span class="caps">UK</span>?
Given the sickly state of the British economy and the uncertainty
surrounding Brexit, that could certainly happen. If so, there is no
indication that the sort of soft end of austerity practised in
Portugal would be able to cope with it. On the contrary, I’m inclined
to believe that only a more radical left project which started to look
at asserting public control over investment decisions would be able to
prevent the return of austerity.</p>
<p>So, while the Portuguese experience may suggest a bit more room for
social democracy than I expected, I still don’t think there is all
that much.</p>
