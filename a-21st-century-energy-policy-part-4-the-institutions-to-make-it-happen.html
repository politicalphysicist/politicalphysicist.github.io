            <p><em>I have written a series of four articles discussing Britain’s energy

framework capable of building the electricity infrastructure needed.</em></p>

As discussed in Part 3, the transition to a low-carbon economy is a
massive task which will require extensive government
intervention. During the most recent leadership campaign, Jeremy
Corbyn promised to “promote the growth of over 200 ‘local energy
companies’” and to “support the development of 1,000 community energy
co-operatives”. Although the exact meaning is unclear, presumably by
“local energy companies” he is referring to council-owned gas and
electricity distributors such as Nottingham’s
<a href="https://robinhoodenergy.co.uk/">Robin Hood Energy</a>. The “community
energy co-operatives” would appear to refer the small generators of
renewable electricity which can be found across Britain. The
<a href="http://www.brightonenergy.org.uk/">Brighton Energy Co-operative</a>
presents an example.</p>
<p>While placing electricity distribution in the hands of local authorities
may well be a good idea, it is important to consider what Corbyn’s
proposal actually involves. It is in no way, shape, or form
nationalisation of any part of the electricity industry. In Nottingham,
the physical infrastructure is owned by <a href="http://www.westernpower.co.uk/Home.aspx">Western Power
Distribution</a>, a subsidiary of
the American energy company <span class="caps">PPL</span> Corporation. Nor do all Nottingham
residents purchase their electricity from the council; Robin Hood Energy
is simply one option along with the Big Six and other, smaller,
competitors. In fact, the way the energy market is currently regulated
means that Robin Hood Energy must offer to sell electricity and gas to
people all across Britain. Should such municipal companies become
wide-spread across the <span class="caps">UK</span>, one would expect them to make inroads
against the Big Six, but remain only one set of players in the market.
This would not address the problems of money wasted on advertising,
promotions, and the bureaucracy needed to manage people changing suppliers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is almost nothing positive to be said about
energy co-operatives. In most sectors, a co-operative is owned by its
employees or its customers, but for energy this is not the case.
Instead, locals become members of the co-operative by <a href="http://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/uploads/attachments/renewableenergy_0_0_0.pdf">paying to finance
new energy projects</a>.
Given the way the energy market is structured in the <span class="caps">UK</span>, it is
impossible for them to then buy their power from the co-op. Instead, the
co-op sells its power to one of the energy supply companies and returns
the profits to its investors as dividends. These are generous dividends
at that: Brighton Energy Co-operative aims to make a <a href="http://www.brightonenergy.org.uk/financial-benefits/">5% return on
investment each
year</a>, which is
substantially higher than the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/uk">cost of servicing public-sector
borrowing</a>.
Despite all their talk of “community ownership”, energy co-ops would
appear to have far more in common with Margaret Thatcher’s “share-owning
democracy” than with a socialist vision of society and are a far-cry
from Corbyn’s calls, early in his first leadership campaign, to
nationalise the energy companies.</p>
<h3>Historical Energy Ownership</h3>
<p><img alt="The CEGB logo. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CEGB.png" src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/energyPolicy/CEGB.png"/> While the exact structure of the nationalised British electrical sector
changed somewhat under different post-war governments, it was broadly as
follows. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228961/0315.pdf">Central Electricity Generating
Board</a>
(<span class="caps">CEGB</span>) owned all power plants and the national grid. The distribution
infrastructure (wires leading into people’s homes) was owned by 14 area
electricity boards. The <span class="caps">CEGB</span> was responsible for ensuring that there was
always sufficient electricity supply for the country, which was bought
by the area electricity boards and then sold on to customers. Scotland
had a somewhat different structure to this, which is beyond the scope of
this article.</p>
<p>Upon privatisation, the <span class="caps">CEGB</span> was split up into the national grid and
three generating companies. These were sold off over a few years,
along with the area electricity boards. Today, there are four
components to the
sector. <a href="http://www2.nationalgrid.com/about-us/our-history/">National Grid plc</a>
owns the high-voltage transmission lines and is the “system operator”
(turning power plants on and off to match supply and
demand). Similarly, in each region there will be a single company
owning and maintaining the
<a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/electricity/distribution-networks/gb-electricity-distribution-network">distribution network</a>.
Generation consists of various companies, ranging from giants like
<a href="https://www.edfenergy.com/energy"><span class="caps">EDF</span></a> to small renewable
<a href="http://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/uploads/attachments/renewableenergy_0_0_0.pdf">energy co-ops</a>.
Finally, there are the supply companies that we all actually purchase
our electricity from. The
<a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/electricity/retail-market/gb-electricity-retail-market">supply companies</a>
purchase electricity on a
<a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/electricity/wholesale-market/gb-electricity-wholesale-market">wholesale market</a>
from various generating companies. <!--Vertical integration is not allowed
in this system; a single company is not allowed to be both a generator
and a supplier. Needless to say, many companies get around this by
using different subsidiaries. Hence companies like SSE own power
plants, distribution networks, and energy suppliers.--></p>
<p>Initially upon nationalisation, gas was the responsibility of 12 <a href="http://www.gasarchive.org/Nationalisation.htm">area
gas boards</a>, with a
central Gas Council acting a a coordinator and liaison with the
government. In the 1970s these boards were merged in to the single
<a href="http://www.gasarchive.org/BritishGasCorp.htm">British Gas Corporation</a>.
Prior to privatisation, the Thatcher government required British Gas to
carry natural gas for other suppliers. Unlike electricity, gas was
privatised as a single unit, becoming <a href="http://www.gasarchive.org/privatisation1.htm">British Gas
plc</a>. A series of
restructurings and demergers followed, with the <a href="http://www.gasarchive.org/privatisation2.htm">gas mains now owned by
National Grid plc</a>.
Exploration, production, storage, and sale of gas is now performed by
various companies.</p>
<h3>The Ownership Structures of Tomorrow</h3>
<p>So much for the past; what of the future? The three over-riding
requirements for a 21<sup>st</sup> century electricity sector are to
produce energy cleanly, reliably, and as cheaply as possible. A Labour
government must act to ensure rapid decarbonisation of the electricity
supply, while at the same time increasing electricity production and
ensuring that the lights remain on. As all low-carbon sources of
electricity are capital-intensive and have slow return on investment, the
only way to make the private sector build it is to provide generous
fixed prices for the electricity. This is expensive, so it makes far
more sense to build these projects in the public sector, especially
given the low interest rates at which a government can borrow. Thus,
public ownership is a practical policy in this situation.</p>
<p>A newly-created Power Generation Board (<span class="caps">PGB</span>) would be given a strict and
aggressive time-table to build new infrastructure with which to
decarbonise Britain’s electricity supply and begin replacing
non-electric energy sources. The exact details of how this would be
achieved are a technical matter best addressed by experts. However,
for reasons discussed in earlier sections, it seem clear that nuclear
power will have to play a major part in any sustainable energy mix.</p>
<p><img alt="The logo for former state enterprise British Nuclear Fuels Limited." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/energyPolicy/BNFL.png"/>
Nuclear power is cheapest when built by a public sector with
capacities for economic planning and direction, as was the case for
France in the 1970s. Currently Britain lacks such capacities. To begin
to regain them, measures should be taken to concentrate nuclear
expertise in the state.  One important step in this direction would be
nationalising the existing nuclear power plants, to be placed in the
hands of the <span class="caps">PGB</span>. Furthermore, an additional state enterprise, in the
vein of the old
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nuclear_Fuels_Ltd">British Nuclear Fuels Limited</a>
(<span class="caps">BNFL</span>), should be created and tasked with developing new reactor
designs, advising the <span class="caps">PGB</span>, decommissioning old reactors, proposing new
fuel cycles, examining issues around waste, etc. Initially, it would
be formed out of the existing
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/nuclear-decommissioning-authority">Nuclear Decommissioning Authority</a>,
with all outsourced operations brought back in-house, and the
<a href="http://www.nnl.co.uk/">National Nuclear Laboratory</a>. The Office for
Nuclear Regulation (“Ofnuke”) would remain strictly independent from
both this enterprise and the <span class="caps">PGB</span>. Britain should support international
cooperation and research in the nuclear sector and, contrary to
current Conservative plans, remain a member of
<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/euratom/index_en.cfm">Euratom</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the cost of government borrowing is lower than the returns
expected by private (even co-operative) electricity producers, it would
also make sense to nationalise the existing renewable infrastructure. As in
the case of nationalising nuclear reactors, this has the further
advantaging of bringing expertise into the public sector. On the other
hand, given that fossil fuel assets are to be phased out as rapidly as
possible, it would likely be better to leave most of these in the
private sector and avoid the public having to pay decommissioning costs.
The <span class="caps">PGB</span> would act as a single purchaser (monopsony) for all
privately-produced electricity, which would provide an effective form of
public control over this sector. In order to ensure that pressure to cut
electricity costs does not lead to poorer pay or working conditions in
the private companies, sectoral collective bargaining should be used. In
the event that the <span class="caps">PGB</span> deems the cost of purchasing electricity
privately is greater than the cost of nationalising the producer, the
producer should be taken into public ownership.</p>
<p>Such an arrangement would require a radical change to current
regulations. At a minimum, distribution companies must be prohibited
from purchasing electricity from anyone other than the <span class="caps">PGB</span>, in order to
ensure that low-carbon electricity is being used. Given this, the <span class="caps">PGB</span>
should take over the role of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_system_operator">transmission system
operator</a>
from National Grid plc. Ideally, the transmission infrastructure itself
would also be nationalised, although this is not strictly necessary for
the energy transition described here.</p>
<p>A monopoly in generation also means there is little point in having
competing distribution companies selling electricity to customers or
in separating them from the distribution networks. In the event of
devolution to the English regions, a tidy approach would be to require
each of them (along with Scotland and Wales) to maintain an
electricity board to operate the distribution infrastructure and be
the monopoly supplier of power to consumers. It would also be possible
to have local authorities play this roll. In either case, it should be
illegal for them to reprivatise these assets. Alternatively, the <span class="caps">PGB</span>
could perform this role too, forming a fully vertically-integrated
utility. While this might achieve greater economy of scale and such a
move was
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228961/0315.pdf">recommended in the 1970s</a>,
it does somewhat cut against the present zeitgeist for localism.</p>
<h3>Nationalisation Costs</h3>
<p>There would be a cost of nationalising the electricity transmission and
distribution networks. This might lead some to argue that a Labour
government should hold off on such actions. However, it makes more sense
to structure the <span class="caps">PGB</span> and any newly-created public distributors to be
able to operate these assets from the start rather than have to
reorganise them later. Additionally, the cost of servicing any debt
incurred would almost certainly be less than the cost of paying to use
these networks.</p>
<p>While it has been claimed that nationalising the energy sector would
cost an eye-watering
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/07/jeremy-corbyns-bill-nationalising-energy-sector-185bn">£185 billion</a>,
this number is flawed as it assumes compensation would be paid at
full-market rates and that overseas assets would also be purchased.
<a href="http://www.psiru.org/sites/default/files/2016-04-E-UK-public.pdf">Another report</a>
argued that compensation could be provided only at the value of a
company’s equity, making nationalising Britain’s electricity
transmission and distribution infrastructure cost £8.4
billion<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Nationalising all of the Big 6 would cost £44.4
billion. However, there is no need to expropriate their supply
businesses—these would simply become obsolete with the introduction
of publicly-owned ones. As stated above, fossil fuel power plants
would be left in the private sector—at least initially. Given that
all of these companies have diverse energy portfolios, the cost of
nationalising just nuclear and renewable generation can only be
estimated. The Big 6 make up
<a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/chart/wholesale-electricity-generation-market-shares-company-2015-gb">about 70%</a>
of the <span class="caps">UK</span> generation market. If all of their equity is in this portion
of of their business, then the equity-value of the entire generation
sector is about £63.4 billion. Nuclear and renewable sources supply
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/513244/Press_Notice_March_2016.pdf">about 45%</a>
of Britain’s electricity, so the cost of nationalising this
infrastructure should be about £30 billion. It must be stressed that
this is an extremely pessimistic number, as it assumes all equity is
tied up in generation infrastructure.</p>
<p>As gas should be phased out and replaced with electricity, there is
little point in nationalising this side of the energy industry. Should
some other use be found for parts of the gas network (e.g. transporting
hydrogen or providing district heating) then the relevant portions of it
should be brought into public ownership. The supply-side of this
industry could either be regulated or this role could be performed in
the public sector, e.g. by councils or the <span class="caps">PGB</span>.</p>
<h3>European Energy Directives</h3>
<p>The above represents an idealised scenario for energy ownership.
However, it is in radical violation of current <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/energy/node/50"><span class="caps">EU</span> energy
policy</a>. This policy requires an
open market, unbundling of electricity distribution from generation, and
regulators independent from government. During Brexit negotiations,
Britain should strive to avoid being bound by these directives. Should
this prove unsuccessful, then there are two options: knowingly
disobeying the directives or adapting the above strategy to lie within them.</p>
<p>Could this plan be sufficiently adapted? The following components would
not be possible: integrating the system operator into the <span class="caps">PGB</span>, requiring
all electricity to be purchased from the <span class="caps">PGB</span>, permitting private
generators only to sell to the <span class="caps">PGB</span>, and creating a public monopoly in supply.
It would still be possible to have the system operator in the public
sector and to direct it to prefer clean energy sources over fossil
fuels, so long as it in no way favoured the <span class="caps">PGB</span>. It would also be
possible to require a certain portion of electricity purchased by
private suppliers to be clean.</p>
<p>Should an electricity wholesale market remain in any form, it will
likely make investment in new energy sources more difficult. All
low-carbon electricity has high capital costs but low operating costs.
This means that investment only makes sense if future electricity prices
are known. When electricity is produced by a single
vertically-integrated supplier this is the default position, but not so
in a market where the wholesale price fluctuates on an hourly basis. The
existence of multiple suppliers is also problematic, as it would prevent
more direct means of controlling price and tariff structures.
Inefficiencies associated with having multiple suppliers, such as
marketing and promotional deals, would persist. If Britain chooses to
stick to the <span class="caps">EU</span> energy regulations, then we will have to content
ourselves with much less direct means of influencing the energy system
and the possibility that companies will be able to exploit loopholes or
sabotage government plans.</p>
<p>Most concerning of all, European officials <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/commission-set-for-climb-down-on-ownership-unbundling/">have
indicated</a>
that state-backed investment and regulated prices (as done during
France’s past build-out of nuclear reactors) would violate state-aid
rules. As that is the model set forth here for Britain, this is very
worrying. This must be the ultimate red-line. Without this
form of state-aid, decarbonisation is all but impossible. Whatever is
decided with regards to the existence of an electricity market, the <span class="caps">UK</span>
must be willing to violate <span class="caps">EU</span> rules on state aid.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Energy policy is a highly technical matter involving politics,
economics, engineering, fundamental physics, and law. Books can, and
have, been written on these matters, so this series of articles can
only provide an overview of the issues. As has been seen, transition
to a low carbon economy will not be easy and will not be possible
using only (or even mainly) renewable energy. Nuclear power must play
a role. The sort of transition described here will require not only
active state intervention in the energy sector, but in many other
parts of the economy as well. A Labour government intent on protecting
the environment must be prepared for the magnitude of the task and be
willing to violate <span class="caps">EU</span> directives in order to achieve it. To paraphrase
a cliché, the choice before us is clear: socialism or environmental disaster.</p>
