the Left-supported social democratic government in Portugal. It struck
me as the best argument against my suspicion that there isn’t room for
a classical social democratic policy anymore. This was brought to the
fore yesterday when a Portuguese member of the Labour Party in Oxford
posted a link to the local Momentum Facebook group to a pamphlet
called
&lt;a href="http://www.feps-europe.eu/assets/8fe67afb-3ddd-4ccf-b35e-baa2ece549df/book-portugal-dec2017-web-pppdf.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Portuguese Government Solution: The “Fourth Way” to Social-Democratic Politics?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This
was produced by a European social democratic think-tank
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FEPS&lt;/span&gt;—Foundation for European Progressive Studies) looking at the
model provided by the Socialist Party government in Portugal and
suggesting this shows “that there is a way for these parties to
reaffirm a left-wing agenda within the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Catarina Martins and prime minister António Costa, leaders of the radical leftPortuguese party Bloco de Esquerda and the social democratic Socialist Party, respectively." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/Catarina-Martins-e-António-Costa.jpg"/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Catarina Martins and prime minister António Costa, leaders of the radical leftPortuguese party Bloco de Esquerda and the social democratic Socialist Party, respectively.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document explains how in 2015 the right wing government which had
been pursuing fierce austerity lost its overall majority in parliament
(while still remaining the largest party). The Socialist Party (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;)
chose not to support them or to enter a grand coalition, instead
opting to form a minority government with the support of the radical
Bloco de Esquerda (Left Bloc) and the orthodox Communist Party of
Portugal (as well as the latter’s close allies, the Greens). While
there were large areas of disagreement between these parties, they
were able to form a set of mutually agreed policy which reversed
course on austerity while respecting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; rules. Representatives of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;
say that this was largely consistent with what they had run on, except
with the implementation of some policies accelerated. They have since
celebrated the success of this government, claiming it has functioned
far more smoothly than anyone expected and that the economy has
started growing again while the deficit has fallen to within
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;-sanctioned levels. The government is popular, with support for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;
growing significantly and staying relatively stable for the juniour partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had read a fair bit about the situation in Portugal when this
government was formed in late 2015, but had not heard much
since. Nonetheless, much what I was reading ran counter to the more
critical line I remembered coming from members of Bloco
at the time. As
such, I read the report with a great deal of scepticism. One thing
which I noticed, in particular, was how modest most of the measures
enacted by the government were. By and large, they were simply
reversing some of the worst policies of the previous government, doing
little to actually implement new progressive policy. Personally, I
would question whether that really amounts to a repudiation of the
Third Way and a return to social democracy’s roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very interested to hear Bloco’s side of the story. I started by
rereading some of the
&lt;a href="(https://jacobinmag.com/2015/11/bloco-esquerda-portugal-silva-ps-pcp-be-austerity-merkel-troika)"&gt;material produced in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. These
contradcited on a number of assertions made by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FEPS&lt;/span&gt; report,
starting with the idea that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; had campaigned on ending
austerity. On the contrary, Bloco members claimed that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; had run a
contradictory campaign and ran on policies similar to those of their
right wing opponents. As such, it was
&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/10/left-bloc-portugal-austerity-social-democracy"&gt;initially expected&lt;/a&gt;
that they would support a minority right wing government. In fact, it
seems to be a running theme that Bloco was overly pessimistic about
the prospects for a left government. They didn’t expect &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; to be
interested in trying to build one, then they didn’t expect &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; to agree
to their demands, and then they assumed that fulfilling even these
modest demands would quickly require defying &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; budgetary rules and
collapse the government. In all of this they have proven to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really wanted to learn, though, was how the situation had
progressed since then. Unfortunately, much of the international
left-wing websites are very good about reporting on developments when
something exciting like an election happen, while very bad at letting
us know what actually comes of those events. After a bit of digging I
found an
&lt;a href="https://www.freitag.de/autoren/der-freitag/die-austeritaet-ist-eine-grosse-luege"&gt;interview with Bloco’s leader&lt;/a&gt;,
Catarina Martins, from sometime last year. While published in German,
Google Translate proved sufficiently advanced for me to get a good grasp
of the interview. It is clear that Martins views the government’s
achievements as extremely limited. She points out that most of what it
has done has simply been to stop the implementation of new austerity
and reverse some of what had already been applied, as I noted
earlier. She does not consider Portugal to have a left government, as
government inaction has been woefully inadequate to address the deep
problems facing the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting corrective, but didn’t provide the deep level
of analysis I was looking for to contrast with the &lt;em&gt;The Portuguese
Government Solution&lt;/em&gt;. After some rooting around on the
&lt;a href="https://www.rosalux.de/en/"&gt;Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung&lt;/a&gt; website, I
eventually found an English-language report written by Bloco and Die
Linke activist Catarina Príncipe (whom I hold in high regard as a
leftist commentator). This report, titled
&lt;a href="https://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/sonst_publikationen/Politics_of_Toleration_Portugal.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-Austerity and the Politics of Toleration in Portugal: A way for the Radical Left to develop a transformative project?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
explains the government experience from Bloco’s point of view; indeed,
although I am not certain of this, possibly from the perspective of
someone on the left of Bloco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report provides background on the pre-2015 political situation in
Portugal which complements that of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FEPS&lt;/span&gt;. Once again, Príncipe
emphasised how Bloco had not expected a deal to be reached to support
a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; government. As such, they were on the back foot during
negotiations from the start. Where the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; spoke of many policies as
though they had always supported, this report indicates that in fact
they were pushed by Bloco and the Communists against great
resistence. While the government has introduced some progressive
measures, it was pointed out that Bloco has not been completely
successful in preventing new privatisation, particularly of banks
which were bailed out by the state at massive cost to the public
purse. While not stated outright, my reading suggests that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; pressure
contributed to those privatisations. It is noted that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; demanded
new cuts in some areas to offset increased social spending, while &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NATO&lt;/span&gt;
insisted on an increase in the military budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Príncipe also present a considerably less optimistic view of the state
of the economy in Portugal. She points out that while the revival is
partially due to citizens now having more spending power, it is also
heavily dependent on external factors such as an increase in tourism
and the low price of oil. Crucially, it is the result of unused
economic capacity being utilised once again and not of new
investment. In
&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/chapo-trap-house/episode-132-blocos-modern-life-81217"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt;
(starts at 24:56)
she says that public investment is extremely low, with the funds
instead being used for increases in current expenditure. Likewise,
there has been little investment in the private sector. This
contradicts claims made in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FEPS&lt;/span&gt; report, although some of their
investment figures are only in terms of year-on-year percent
increases, which could simply be hiding a very low starting
point. Príncipe feels that the lack of investment and precarious state
of the financial sector leaves Portugal’s economy vulnerable. Should
there be a new downturn or crisis, she predicts that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;
will quickly insist on the return to austerity in order to balance budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report ends with an assessment of Bloco’s strategy, as well as
some notes on the relation of the Left to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. While acknowledging
that Bloco had little choice but to support the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; government,
Príncipe is clearly uncomfortable with parts of the direction her
party has taken. At times this comes across quite clearly in the
above-mentioned interview. She suggests ways in which the party must
be reoriented away from an overly parliamentary focus and seek to
build the capacity to fully challenge austerity and even capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some areas of clear contradiction between the two accounts,
particularly around the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;’s electoral campaign and levels of
investment in the Portuguese economy. Not being able to read
Portuguese, I’m unable to properly assess who is correct in these
areas. Overall, however, I find Príncipe’s account of the situation to
be the more convincing one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are the consequences for a Labour government trying to
implement something like the
&lt;a href="https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/"&gt;2017 election manifesto&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;?
That manifesto was, after-all, essentially just a return to mild
social democracy (although John McDonnell’s
&lt;a href="https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Alternative-Models-of-Ownership.pdf"&gt;Alternative Models of Ownership&lt;/a&gt;
report starts to point in some more radical directions). In one
regard, at least, Labour will have it easier: even in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;
retains more control of its monetary and fiscal policy than Portugal
by virtue of not being in the Euro. On the other hand, there are a
number of difficulties. For one, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; has implemented this program
with Bloco and the Communists in parliament holding their feet to the
fire. Labour would have no such anti-capitalist left force keeping
them accountable. On the contrary, they would have a rump of
right-wing MPs who may well defy party discipline and vote against
even mildly progressive measures. What’s more, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; remains very
much an establishment party whose leaders are trusted by Portuguese
and European capital. The same can not be said of the current Labour leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour’s program would also go considerably further than what has been
done in Portugal, to include much greater increases in social spending
and some nationalisation. These measures are more likely to antagonise
capital, with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBI&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/labour-nationalisation-hard-brexit-cbi-president-paul-dreschler-a8252136.html"&gt;already denouncing&lt;/a&gt;
the latter and claiming they would deter investment. Perhaps this is
just an empty threat (there was plenty of such rhetoric during the
formation of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; government), but perhaps not. British capital is
very powerful, after all, and has often defeated measures which its
European counterparts accommodated themselves to. The fact that the
British economy is so depending on the City of London’s status as the
global financial hub may also constrain a future Labour government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of all, we must remember how vulnerable the Portuguese
government is. If Príncipe is to be believed, the economic recovery
has been contingent on factors outside of their control. Should the
economy sour, the entire project of “turning the page on
austerity” would be at risk. What if there is a recession in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;?
Given the sickly state of the British economy and the uncertainty
surrounding Brexit, that could certainly happen. If so, there is no
indication that the sort of soft end of austerity practised in
Portugal would be able to cope with it. On the contrary, I’m inclined
to believe that only a more radical left project which started to look
at asserting public control over investment decisions would be able to
prevent the return of austerity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while the Portuguese experience may suggest a bit more room for
social democracy than I expected, I still don’t think there is all
that much.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Austerity"></category><category term="Europe"></category><category term="Bloco de Esquerda"></category><category term="Socialism"></category></entry><entry><title>Oxford &amp; District Labour Party AGM 2018</title><link href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/oxford-district-labour-party-agm-2018.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-09T23:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-03-09T23:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>C.

&lt;p&gt;None.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;National Nominations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were moved ahead to give more time to count ballots (unanimously
approved). Late arrivals will be able to submit ballots right until
the originally scheduled time. See the
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/agm18-nc-nominations.docx"&gt;list of candidates&lt;/a&gt; to the
national positions, with candidate statements and lists of those
nominating them to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treasurer’s Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had £15k more income than anticipated, due to the general
election. About £5k more was spent than expected due to the election,
although lost the organiser so savings on payroll. Surplus of £9000,
although £3000 deferred expenditure to pay salary of
organiser. Surplus largely due to large donation from a
union. Projecting balanced budget for this year. Increased income
donated by Labour Group of councillors. More money will be spent on
conference delegates (sending two per &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLP&lt;/span&gt;, rather than one). Want to
keep things reasonably solid so can do the campaigning they want
without having to worry about cost. Accounts unanimously approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Officers’ Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/agm18-officers-reports.docx"&gt;These reports&lt;/a&gt; were sent in
advance (I didn’t read them). The chair gave a brief summary of her
report. She was pleased to fight on a “socialist” manifesto and see
how popular it was. She was pleased at how all of the 10 key positions
in the local party/government are filled by women. Thanked retiring
council leader. Congratulated equalities commission and diverse slate
of candidates, though we can’t rest on our laurels. Talked about how
to broaden support and campaign beyond canvassing. Talked about
needing to be welcoming to everyone and respectful of all views. Team
will try to be inclusive. Thanked Ann Black for her hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No objections to the reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Amendments to Rules and Standing Orders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Smith proposed
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/agm18-camp-comm-members.docx"&gt;changes to campaign committee&lt;/a&gt;,
though Ann spoke on it. Only meets 3 times a year and operates on
ad-hoc basis, but has become something of a club of friends. Want to
formalise it. Spending decisions will be OKed by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GM&lt;/span&gt;. All branches
will now send representatives. No questions or challenges were made
and it was passed overwhelmingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Election of Officers and Delegates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were sent a
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/agm18-nominations.docx"&gt;list of nominated candidates&lt;/a&gt; in
advance. More detailed
&lt;a href="agm18-candidates-statements.docx"&gt;candidate statements&lt;/a&gt; were also provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all officer posts were uncontested. One of the challengers for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAME&lt;/span&gt;
Officer withdrew, so that is no longer contested (Momentum candidates
winning by default). We will hear speeches from trade union
officer. At least one conference delegate must be female. Conference
delegates are elected by first past the post (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FPTP&lt;/span&gt;). Luke Akehurst asked
about run-off voting and said it should be done this way in
future. Ann Black rebuked him as having ample opportunity to raise
such a procedural issue and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FPTP&lt;/span&gt; has always been used in the past so
it’s not like it’s a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Ladbroke (incumbent) spoke about how trade unionists are transformative and
how nice it is to be in a position which allows him to work with those
who are actually fighting back. Has worked on living wage campaign,
including with competitor. Said up to Peter if wants to continue
working jointly with him in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Nowland  who I don’t recognise) said would
like to work with Mark to get unions back into workplaces fighting for
better conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unclear whether were proposing job-sharing. Ann seemed to indicate it
would be working together on a more informal basis, as they had not
been nominated on a jobshare. At last minute the two candidates did
agree to jobshare, so no contested positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couldn’t be bothered to take detailed notes on conference delegate
speeches. Some were obvious Corbynites, some were obvious
anti-Corbynites. Most were a bit more guarded on these issues. I
already knew who were the Momentum candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oxford City Labour Group&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/agm18-oxford-city-council-report.pdf"&gt;This report&lt;/a&gt; was
emailed sent with the email. The council leader was here to take any
questions, but there didn’t appear to be any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oxfordshire County Labour Group&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report was supposed to have been sent in advance, but I couldn’t
find it. The leader of the group wasn’t here, but a councillor was
present to take questions. She started by noting that the group
managed to get £500k maintained in homelessness services. Also that
voted against Tory idea of giving some new central government money to
councillors to administer, instead wanting it to go to children’s services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parliamentary Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anneliese’s printed report didn’t seem to make it to me, somehow. She started
by mentioning the Oxfam crisis, as they are a major employer in the
city. Employees admitted bad mistakes were made, but expressed concern
that the Right is using it as an excuse to gut foreign aid,
particularly where it involves more political charities such as
Oxfam. The minister claims no weaponisation of the issue, but
Anneliese feels this is not her experience. Also stressed that lessons
need to be learned beyond just the charity structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reiterated that Corbyn has committed to membership of “a” customs
union, saying she thinks this is the right decision and what she hoped
Labour would move to. Also campaigning against the government using
Brexit as an attempt to grab power and avoid parliamentary
scrutiny. Recently the government has tried to water down anti-money
laundering laws and Anneliese thinks they might be able to pull some
Tories towards them on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadow treasury team is preparing for spring statement. Supposedly
will be no changes to spending etc. in it, but will reveal the bad
state of the economy. Tories will try to spin it as not as bad as
everyone thought, but it is still bad. Hoping can use this as an
opportunity to push them on council funding. Cuts to taxes benefiting
companies and the rich were made at the same time council funding was
drastically cut. Those decisions will have long-term costs for our communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Tanner asked when Labour will come out in favour of single market
membership. Anneleise felt the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; will be “rule-takers” whether in
single market or not. Seems to indicate single market membership is
her preferred option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone else asked whether the number of Tory councils facing
bankruptcy might force the government to soften its
approach. Apparently MPs are trying to bring this up with
Conservatives. They just say “councils can raise council tax”, which
is cynical for obvious reasons. Would mean those on low income would
be paying for central government tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was a question on homelessness; something about it’s relation to
national policy. Theresa May seemed to be trying to spin action as
helping with homelessness, nut planning bill doesn’t really change
power imbalance between councils and developers. Trying to give
free-market solutions to a problem that requires public action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone from student union asked about what Labour is doing locally
and nationally to support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCU&lt;/span&gt; strike. Anneleise noted how she was a
lecturer and as, a student, managed to get &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USS&lt;/span&gt; ethically invested. As
such she is appalled by what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UUK&lt;/span&gt; is doing to it now. Has been asked to
sign an early day motion on this, but as a front-bencher she has to be
told to do so by whips. She hopes she will be allowed to sign it soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone brought up university hospitals where, in exchange for 2% pay
rise for next 3 years staff are being asked not to take annual
leave. This, of course, is leading to even deeper
demoralisation. Labour feared this sort of thing when Tories formally
removed pay cap a few months ago. In any case, that’s a
below-inflation pay rise. Where pay rises do occur, it seems to come
out of services, but Labour has shown that cancelling tax cuts would
allow everyone to have proper raises. She met with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCG&lt;/span&gt; recently but
stressed they are between a rock and a hard place. Conservatives
claiming problems in Oxford are just down to local management not
adopting Tory policies is absurd. Someone pointed out lots of people
are doing unpaid work already and Anneliese agreed the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; is just
running on goodwill and if there were work to rule the whole thing
would fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eastern Ghouta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann acted as proposer because the proposers in the branch
were absent. This was asking Corbyn to condemn Assad’s action in one
region. I don’t know what to think of this one, given that it’s a war
against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISIS&lt;/span&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone spoke against (also did so at branch, but was caught by
surprise then). He said he knows this was tabled with good intentions,
but believes that in the context we should oppose it. Said Boris
Johnson is threatening airstrikes in Syria and Trump wants to start a
war somewhere. Had two parliamentary debates on action in Syria over
last few years. This motion would help provide a pretext for western
bombing. Said these are the kinds of arguments which led to disaster
in Iraq and Libya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone said “we need to do something”, which I find unconvincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another person insisted this does not provide a pretext for
international intervention. Said Assad is responsible for the vast
majority of civilian casualties, according to Amnesty International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Akehurst said in motions we should vote for what is written on
paper. No reason not to vote for calling for immediate ceasefires and
humanitarian corridors. Only military intervention mentioned in motion
is that of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone claimed motion is completely unbalanced for condemning what
Russia is doing but not Al Queda for controlling regions and refusing
to let civilians leave. Felt is was one-sided because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn’t count number in favour. 11 against and “more than a dozen
abstentions”. I abstained, feeling I had insufficient knowledge to
judge. Passed overwhelmingly. I couldn’t quite tell, but I think some
Momentum members voted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane Stockton spoke as mover for this, noting that she hopes it isn’t
controversial. Calls on party at local level to act against 5 year
plan for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; and introduction of “accountable care
organisations”. Labour-controlled bodies mentioned in the motion, such
as the city council, have the power to call for changes to be
halted and reviewed at a higher level. This is in line with national
policy. We need to act now to prevent damage being done before Labour
makes it into power. In other areas nearby we have seen such action be
successful. Have failed to halt privatisation and downgrades, so must
do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A speaker (consultant at the hospitals) emphasised that narrative we
hear of needing to carry out central government policy is false. In
other areas there has been management resistance, but needs to be
popular pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one wanted to speak against. Passed unanimously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Immigration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This motion called for proper debate in
the party on immigration and the different types of immigration. Was
based on a discussion in the branch. Couldn’t really do a complicated
issue like this through a simple motion. Want to use leavers of the
party (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt;, etc.) to get a proper discussion going, with goal of
bringing something to Conference in 2019. Pointed out that for most
people immigration is a secondary issue. Speaker says Labour should be
a party that welcomes immigrants, but need a proper policy on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone spoke against language which suggests good immigrants and bad
immigrants and proposed that sentence be removed. Another felt motion
was poorly worded, unclear, and can reproduce negative ideas on
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. Pointed out a number of problematic sentences. Felt motion
emphasised what is good for country (vague) but not what’s good for
immigrants. Said language of compassion is in contradiction with
continuing to support border regimes. Wants to have free
movement (what with “migration crisis”) paid for by taxing the global
rich. More people wanted to speak against, but standing orders seemed
to require any additional speakers to be in favour for reasons of balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, John Tanner asked for motion to be returned to branch to
remove problematic wording. This was accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results of Elections and Nominations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Oxford East conference delegates there was a 3-way tie between
Becky, Dan, and Marie, so we had to do a revote. Results were somewhat
delayed as they were not finished yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we waited we heard from the taxi driver (can’t remember name and
don’t see it written down) who was fired for being a trade union shop
steward. Reported on how his tribunal over this was a failure. Will be
launching an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both CLPs nominated the entire left slate for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEC&lt;/span&gt; (plus Ann
Black). Oxford East for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; had 3 of the left slate but a recount is
needed for the last one (youth is uncontested). West &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; nominations
were also left slate. Oxford East conference delegates: Becky and a
tie between Dan and Marie. There was a runoff, but at the end of the
meeting there was still a tie. Since some delegates had left by the,
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GM&lt;/span&gt; decided (by popular request) to look at whether they could
afford to send all 3. In West, at least one and possibly both of the
Momentum candidates were chosen as delegates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I missed this result on the night but I found out the next day that
bot CLPs voted against nominating an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NCC&lt;/span&gt; candidate. Only a candidate
from the right was on the ballot, so this is what Momentum wanted in
order that we’ll have a chance to nominate someone from the left at
the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were sent &lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/results.zip"&gt;official results&lt;/a&gt; the next day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Labour Party"></category><category term="British Politics"></category><category term="Meetings"></category></entry><entry><title>Oxford &amp; District Labour Party AMM February 2018</title><link href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/oxford-district-labour-party-amm-february-2018.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-09T23:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-02-09T23:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>C.

approved, as was the &lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-02-09-amm/amm-9feb2018-agenda.docx"&gt;agenda for this meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At start of the meeting we had to decide whether to debate a motion on
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; or on Haringey (both submitted by the same branch). Haringey
was selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Giampi Alhadeff, Speaking on Brexit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General secretary of the European Parliamentary Labour Party. Started with lots of waffle, country divided, etc. Identified 4 issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The union of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; (due to the Northern Ireland situation),
   especially with the Good Friday agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jobs and prosperity. Was at lots of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTO&lt;/span&gt; summits (including Seattle)
   and the negotiators are tough. Trade with other countries will hurt
   British sectors, losing jobs. Can’t make up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; trade with overseas
   trade. Any international business will move out (according to
   Japanese Ambassador)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; safety, workers’ rights, and the environment. This is what
   the right-wingers talk about when they mean “red tape”. Want a
   Singapore for European (which won’t happen, but anyway). &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; will
   diverge with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; as latter introduces new laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big issues facing the world: China developing internationally,
   Russia and its meddling abroad, climate change, artificial
   intelligence (peace, business, war, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; will impact the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;’s ability to deal with these
issues. It will address them but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; won’t have a voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem for Labour is 2/3 or members want to remain while 2/3 of
constituencies want to leave. He believes Labour must say that regions
which voted leave will be hit hardest, so let’s remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brexit Motion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A range of views on this. I pointed out some of the downsides of the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. It was amended to remove the talk of a second referendum. The
motion now reads “This meeting believes that the Labour Party’s policy
on Brexit should be to remain in the Customs Union”. This was
overwhelmingly carried
with about 17 votes against and 15 abstentions. Many questioned what
the point of the motion was given that the customs union doesn’t exist
as an institution. Liz noticed that a lot of Momentum people voted for
the motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parliamentary Report from Anneliese Dodds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praised that we had such a passionate but still civil debate on
Brexit. Thinks party should press harder on the customs union issue
because government is currently week on that, especially with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;
expressing doubts about the whole situation in Ireland. Has been
arguing in parliament to support at least &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; and possibly &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;
customs union so that Tories will split on it. Also wants to maintain
unity, as election could be coming earlier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managed to get a vote against a tax treaty rejected, as these are used
for tax avoidance (in the guise of international aid). A few similar
bills which were coming up seem to have vanished… Also pushing
transparency for trust. Other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; countries are coming out against that
but not the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. The lack of transparency is abused for money
laundering, etc. Dealing with some tax issues, particularly how
raising the income tax threshold has &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; (as the government likes to
pretend) solved poverty. Cuts to benefits have had a much bigger
impact. Pushing on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; as the winter crisis is far worse than in
previous years. Sent out an emergency budget for health which showed
where money could be found to help address these issues. Managed to
get a requirement that homes be fit for habitation, now need to make
sure tenants can actually exercise those rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some discussion of Helen and Douglas House (a local hospice). It seems
to be having to close a lot of services because there is no public
money going into it. Talk about trying to get the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCG&lt;/span&gt; to reconsider
given the situation. Meeting gave unanimous permission to send a
letter in our name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Afrin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials were circulated about this. Basically this is Turkey
attacking the Kurdish, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YPG&lt;/span&gt;-controlled areas in northern Syria. Lots of
war crimes, civilian deaths, targeting of women. No one from
international community has spoken up, so the drafter put forward this
motion. Turkey seems to be trying to annex and ethnically cleanse
it. Boris Johnson has effectively supported the invasion saying
Turkey has a right to keep its borders secure. Emotional pleas to
help. One speaker checked to ensure her ammendment noting how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;
is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NATO&lt;/span&gt; member was included (it was) and anther spoke in favour. The
motion was unanimously carried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Haringey and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pointed out how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDV&lt;/span&gt; is a continuation of the disastrous privatisation
agenda which Labour now opposes. Haringey’s attempt at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDV&lt;/span&gt; split
the council and went against CLPs, MPs, unions. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEC&lt;/span&gt; intervened on
behalf of councillors and union members in a very measured
manner. This was all within party rules. Critics have gained massive
coverage in the media, so important to put our views forward. Dan
seconded and drew attention to how broad the opposition to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDV&lt;/span&gt;
is. Motion through the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEC&lt;/span&gt; was unanimously supported (after an
amendment). Luke Akehurst spoke against, claiming not because he
supported &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDV&lt;/span&gt; but because the it fell within spectrum of allowable
policies to be decided on a local level. Nonetheless seemed to speak
in support of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDV&lt;/span&gt;. Claims new council houses, even under Labour,
will be built privately. Another person said it wasn’t our place to
stick the oar in. Others pointed out that our council leader was one
of those condemning the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEC&lt;/span&gt;, making it our business. Overwhelmingly
carried with 6 against and 20 abstentions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rough sleeping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cherry informed me a row is brewing over the provision of this to open
shelters when even one night is predicted to be below freezing (rather
than 3 consecutive nights). The Labour Club says won’t support any
candidates failing to support this, while the council is saying won’t
support candidates who are in favour of it. Momentum councillors (and
prospective councillors) are willing to break rank on this, but best
to get this through at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLP&lt;/span&gt; level to try to force council’s
hand. Richard presented the Southwest Central motion on rough
sleeping. Made a positive case for it, emphasised working with
council, not trying to be confrontational. A Momentum member
(forgotten her name) proposed ammendments supporting rights of
“non-statutory homeless” and civil rights of homeless, which Richard
accepted. These were accepted. Deputy-leader of the council
spoke. Says will be a church open for rough sleepers every night
through January to March. To date have had enough capacity. Says &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWEP&lt;/span&gt;
is inefficient way of doing things and could make it difficult to
extend current scheme. Will still vote for motion, but shouldn’t get
too caught up on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWEP&lt;/span&gt;. Unanimously carried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Executive Committee Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were sent the &lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-02-09-amm/ec-minutes-18jan2018.docx"&gt;full report&lt;/a&gt; in
advance.  Advertised dinner with Keir Starmer. Unfair dismissal rally
tomorrow in support of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMB&lt;/span&gt; taxi drivers, marching from city council to
Osney. Speakers on Afrin offering to speak at branch
meetings. Finally, were some forms to join Labour Movement for Europe
(I did not sign up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEC&lt;/span&gt; Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left as had to leave to let cold weather shelters set up. In advance
we were sent one report by
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-02-09-amm/nec-jan2018-annblack.docx"&gt;Ann Black&lt;/a&gt; and another by

&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2017-10-13-amm/amm-8sep2017-minutes.docx"&gt;minutes of last meeting&lt;/a&gt; and the
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2017-10-13-amm/amm-13oct2017-agenda.docx"&gt;agenda for this meeting&lt;/a&gt;. We
were also provided with the
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2017-10-13-amm/ec-minutes-14sep2017.docx"&gt;minutes for the last &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC&lt;/span&gt; meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oxfordshire county Labour group report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noted massive cuts to council funding. Makes things very
difficult. However, noted one major success of reversing an
outsourcing contract (with company called Carillion). Working to get
home care, school meals, etc. back in house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to open up the cabinet system in the county. Even non-cabinet
Tories fed up and can’t get information. Managed to get a motion
passed to conduct a review, although was watered down somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noted that merging adult social care and health care is missing the
point that quality has suffered due to cuts. For most part these are
different systems so integration pointless. In any case, majority of
people needing social care aren’t eligible for it through the council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have also added system for investigating and addressing elder
abuse. Safeguarding children and children social care becoming a big,
expensive problem. While built new children’s homes to bring back
people who had to be sent out of county. However, that hasn’t happened
because so many new children entering care—often because parents
can’t afford to feed them. Universal Credit will likely make this worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noted in case of closed Children Centres that cuts were made there
because they are non-statutory and the money was needed for
(statutory) children’s social care. Austerity makes it very difficult
to fund statutory requirements and everything else is cut to the bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In responses to questions became clear how shortages of housing,
fragmentation of schools, homelessness, crisis in social care are all
related and feed into each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unitary authority proposal seems to have stalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annual conference report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full written report will be provided with the minutes. Cherry gave
highlights (Lotte was stuck on a bus from Manchester). Was very
positive about the experience, felt was in-tune with everyone for the
first time. Notes how well-organised Women’s Conference was and how
good the speakers were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminded us that there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; discussion of Brexit. She got the
impression that, should talks breakdown and there be a Labour
government then might see it reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part this was a review of what she told us at the
Momentum meeting. For example, she told the story of how the the
compositing process tried to neuter the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Felt that conference is too much to have just one delegate. In future
we should consider sending more. This will be discussed at an
executive meeting next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2017-10-13-amm/nec-conf2017-annblack.docx"&gt;Ann Black circulated a report&lt;/a&gt;
giving a behind-the-scenes view. Notes there were way more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLP&lt;/span&gt;
delegates than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cherry was called out on not voting to debate the Brexit motions. She
said while she wants it reversed (and thinks it will be) she didn’t
want to tie the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLP&lt;/span&gt;’s hands at this point—unlike things like
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; where she does. Ann noted that there was a vote on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEC&lt;/span&gt;
statement of party policy on Brexit and a failed attempt to refer back
part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; International report. She also noted that the Brexit
motions were varied and contradictory. Cherry added that there wasn’t
a clear vision to vote for on the Brexit motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chair said the executive will look to have an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMM&lt;/span&gt; discussing Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oxford city council report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-deputy council leader spoke about a range of issues. Council chief
executive given a 3 year contract, despite continued uncertainty over
local government. Previously just had a 6 month contract. Westgate due
to open on October 24th. Investment going ahead on East Oxford
Community Centre. Zero-emissions zone mentioned (although John Tanner
knows more), which will be a way to help bring down currently-illegal
levels of air pollution. More information on council website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoke about Universal Credit and how disappointed that it will
continue. Delays can cause major hardship in terms of paying rent,
buying food, etc. Have concerns about the government’s advanced
payment system because there is such a quick clawback. City decided to
set up a small fund to help people in dire need. This is needed
because county council was the first in the country to get rid of
their hardship fund. Trying to communicate with landlords to prevent
evictions. Also engaging in a publicity campaign to help claimants
understand the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other deputy leader (not an official post, just something Oxford is
doing) also spoke. Noted that rules now require at least one women in
the three leadership positions. Reported finances are stable and
shouldn’t be any major cuts in services in next few years. Council
taxes will continue to increase at rate allowed without
referendum. Continue benefits for low income people who can’t afford
tax. Capital funding still strong and engaging commercial development
to help pay for services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay deal with unions will expire in a few years which leaves question
mark. More risks have also been shifted onto local authorities. Have
created own building company as way to get around limits for borrowing
for council housing. Have been selling services for past few years to
bring in money, but have been pushing up against legal limits set by
central government. Setting up council-owned company to allow further
expansion of this. Continuing to press central government on housing
benefits. Council will not evict its own tenants and has been trying
to prepare them for changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal restrictions make it difficult to help homeless (especially if
not citizens). Trying to build another hostel and have other housing
options. Commitment to no cuts to homeless services (unlike county
council, which has cut it almost entirely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Council threatening to strip Aung San Suu Kyi of freedom of city if
doesn’t step up around ethnic cleansing. Motion pointing out
importance of single market access to city. Motion on improving
cycling safety. Think I might have missed one because spoke very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked about zero emission zone and what can be done in shorter term
to improve air quality. Noted delivery lorries use those roads a lot
and this will help. I’m pretty sure that requirement won’t go into
force until 2035. Waffled about how changes need to be phased in to
allow people/companies to adjust. No time for me to respond.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BMW&lt;/span&gt; pension dispute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motion to prevent companies dismissing and rehiring workers to
“resolve” a strike (referred to as “termination and
re-engagement”). As we were running over and this is an important
issue we will discuss it next month when there is more time. Will be a
union speaker next month, so will fit in well with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parliamentary report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handed out copy of detailed report. Didn’t speak very long so time for
questions. Says her constituency role is getting harder. Lots of
issues around immigration system, housing, and universal
credit. Contact with Home Office has gotten even worse. Access to the
hotline for Universal Credit only through MPs office, which places an
extra hurdle and makes it harder for advocates. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DWP&lt;/span&gt; no longer sharing
info with council which will make it harder for council to offer
support. Lots of calls to stop the role-out but government haven’t
listened so far. Opposition day debate will be on this and she hopes
maybe they can get something done because situation is terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also talked a bit about conference. She was on compositing committee
for pay cap motion and was quite happy with how that went. Pleased
with treasury announcements, particularly around credit card debt
which she has worked on. Industry hasn’t given much pushback. Positive
about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PFI&lt;/span&gt; announcement and notes that, even if expensive, not changing
it is also expensive. Same applies to tuition fees where public purse
id dealing with much lower payback rate than expected. Feels lots of
common ground in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LP&lt;/span&gt; over transitional period and limiting
consolidation of government power. She’s very concerned about
government policy on customs, which she works on. She feels two
proposals put forward are a mess and badly thought through (either
similar to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; scheme, but not, or different custom scheme for goods
destined for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;). Government accruing more power over severance
payment. Non-dom reform is inadequate and leaves lots of room to avoid
tax. Labour is continuing to develop its own budget plans and draw up
amendments for the upcoming budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked for more details on McDonnell’s “war-gaming”. Backed him on
planning for such thing. Her impression is that business thinks Labour
seems more sane than Tories. Very concerned about complacency in
government over various economic issues and we need to think about how
to deal with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responded to various other questions. Noted in particular that we need
transparency around Brexit. Lack of transparency breads distrust and
doesn’t help anyone. Shouldn’t treat negotiations like a poker game
but as something where we have a grown-up discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to John Tanner after the meeting. He confirmed that lorries will still be allowed in Cornmarket Street until 2035, although their times will be restricted. Other, short-term measures are being looked at for air pollution, such as shifting bus stops (although that requires county-council cooperation). I asked about whether George Street inclusion means busses to Gloucester Green will all have to be electric. He said they will, starting in 2025. This could just be hybrid-electric and using the electric motors while on George Street. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2017-09-08-amm/prev-amm-minutes.docx"&gt;minutes from last meeting&lt;/a&gt; passed
without comment. There was one piece of urgent business, with a city
councillor reminding us about the Oxford Living Wage Campaign and
asking us all to show up to the launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parliamentary Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anneliese thanks us for our help in the election and for continued
campaigning. She mentioned that she thinks the Tories have dug in for
awhile, so we’ll have to stick with the campaigning. Also
congratulated the council election result in Didcot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Brexit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Felt government’s position hasn’t improved over summer and continues
to alienate partners. Reminded us Labour’s position is to have an
interim agreement so that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; won’t fall off a cliff. In the
meantime, Labour is pressing the Tories for details and votes in the
house of commons. Not accepting the government rewriting
labour/environmental laws without discussion. Criticised government
for saying Electric Mini production in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is vote of confident in
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; negotiations—it’s a testament to the quality of the workforce. For
long-term sustainability need a sensible trade relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tax Issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called out the government for continuing to tax redundancy payment
while giving further concessions for non-doms. On the first there will
be a vote but without any debate. Feels government is weak on this,
with only 2 MPs willing to defend finance bill in the commons. Thinks
Labour can push them on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Housing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knows this is important to local activists. Post-Grenfall we were told
would be an open debate on social housing, but it hasn’t happened. The
government still hasn’t changed its views on regulations. Is afraid
Tories will push ahead forcing housing associations to sell
properties. Notes developers in Oxford salivating. Affordability is
still defined too narrowly. Roll-out of Universal Credit is shambolic
and could mean people will lose access to housing benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government trying to manipulate committees so they have a majority and
also timing of committees. Seems to be an attempt to avoid
scrutiny. When asked if anything we can do she only referred to work
of MPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anneleise confirmed reduction in seats in parliament doesn’t seem to
be happening. This would have particularly hurt Labour. Not sure why
government stepped away from this. (Ann heard &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DUP&lt;/span&gt; won’t have it
because would give Sinn Fein extra seats.) Will still be a boundary
review. Will be some changes about parties registering which will make
things more difficult for Labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On questions of unity in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLP&lt;/span&gt;, she said she always seems to get on with
everyone. Wasn’t there when things were tense, so that might
help. Says atmosphere remains good and hopes it will continue. In
particular, hopes it will continue through Conference. If focus can
stay on policies while Tories tear themselves apart then that will put
Labour in a good position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reiterated that doesn’t see the government falling soon. Majorities
typically around 14, which will be hard to break. Was asked about
detailed policy work says trying to strike a balance between
developing detailed policies and keeping focus on broad goals
(i.e. keeping in election footing). Felt good progress being made in
some parts of the party and reported that shadow Treasury team
continues to engage with all relevant stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked how members can get more involved with policy, mentioning that
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; reports are vague and have no content. She didn’t respond to my
question, instead focusing on other questions asked in my tranche (see
next paragraph).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressed concern about international situation (refugees, etc.). Felt
hasn’t been sufficient response in Britain. Reports Labour has been
doing some work on specific issues (such as persecution of Muslims in
Burma). Highlighted insufficient support given to refugees. Wants to
be sure it doesn’t get lost in debate. Agreed with a member that it’s
important for party to stand up against hate crime. Called out Sarah
Champion and worried it’s distracting from real issues of child abuse,
etc. Expressed worry about Islamophobia which has gotten worse since
referendum. Is glad community in Oxford has tended to stand against
any attempt to stir racism etc. up here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressed concern over academics making homophobic comments. Doesn’t
know what was said but feels if students were upset enough to complain
then comments would have to be unacceptable. Equivocated a bit over
vice-chancellor’s high pay. Seemed to be saying she’s concerned with
this being used as a way to claim universities awash with money when aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirmed will continue her work around tax transparency and tackling
tax avoidance. Will bring this up with finance bill next week. Wants
to tighten rules for non-doms and to tackle money laundering, which
Britain is becoming something of a centre for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worker brought up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BMW&lt;/span&gt;’s recent settlement of a pension dispute by
essentially changing a contract. Asked if anything she could do to
help from parliament, particularly if Labour forms government. She
felt would be difficult to resolve situation under current
legislation—will need to be changed. Could potentially become
relevant in context of Brexit. Reminded us this will take a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressed concern about government position on immigration. Doesn’t
like how Tories have made this a big issue. Said Britain has low
unemployment and needs immigrants to fill a wide range of jobs of
varying levels of skills. Feels like immigration system for non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;
citizens isn’t working for immigrants, businesses, public services, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was asked about housing development with very expensive flats. As not
in local government she could only make general comments. Said she
understands it is difficult for local authorities to force developers
to include affordable housing under current law. Hopes new
infrastructure commission for Oxford-Cambridge corridor will allow new
investment in housing, transport, public services in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also see provided handout from Anneliese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annual Conference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Women’s Confernce Arrangement Committee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegates for Women’s Conference not present. Branch delegates chose
who they want our conference delegates to vote for on the
committee. Chair expressed extreme displreasure that that women’s
delegates absent. Was some protest from the floor that there were
extenuating circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resolutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can send two resolutions (one from each constituency). First debate
motions and vote on whether we support them. Then, if all three pass,
choose which ones to prioritise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ending &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; support for Saudi Arabia&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Tanner spoke on importance of ending attack on Yemen and increase
pressure on Suadi’s. Reminded us that motions must be contemporary and
feels recent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt; report means this one is. Resolution also refers to
arms conversion to protect jobs in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; arms industry. Unite has put
out report on past proposals and successful conversions. No one spoke
against, vote unanimous except for one abstention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A publicly owned banking system&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls for nationalising and democratically controlling large
banks. Said was good thing that Labour bailed out banks, but wasn’t
enough control and bad how resulted in austerity. Points out bad
behaviour of Loyd’s and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RBS&lt;/span&gt; while large stakes held by state. Similar
motion being raised in Leeds. Feels this will continue developing
manifesto. Contemporary because final shares in Loyd’s just recent sold
off. One person spoke against saying it’s not a priority (costs lots of
money). Also said looks like there might be another crash and better
wipe-out private equity than public (plus would make cheaper if then
want to nationalise). Felt connection between ownership and control
insufficiently dealt with in motion. Another person spoke about it
being an obvious policy. Someone else pointed out we’d be better off
trying to stop another crash (via nationalisation) and that the public
is on the hook anyway when private equity is lost. Ann Black thought
incoming Labour government will have too much to do without running
banking system. Politicians are not bankers. Not a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28 for, 15 against, 26 abstentions by my count. Committee agreed it
was carried but not by majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; and Accountable Care System&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz said described how new Accountable Care System (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACS&lt;/span&gt;) bundles all
health commissioners etc. in an area and takes it away from public
scrutiny. These are equivalent to HMOs in United States and will make
things ripe for privatisation. Also current move to sell off &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt;
properties which must be opposed. We need these properties to provide
for increased care needs. Highlighted this is needed for next 20
years, not next 2. Motion based on one forwarded by Socialist Health
Association. Seconder reminded of need for more money and for all
Labour officials to oppose any cuts. One person felt there could be
good debate for centralising certain services (based on medical issues
rather than saving money) and worried this motion goes too far in
blanket opposition. Another person said will abstain because arguments
not based on studies of outcomes. Overwelmingly carried with only a
few abstentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we could each cast two votes for which resolutions to submit. I
voted for bank nationalisation and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; motion. Was clear &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; and
Suadi Arabia ones were far more popular—-only a few people voted for
bank nationalisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone spoke for continued membership of the Single Market. Hoped
delegates would raise it at conference.  Another speaker said she
thinks Kier Starmer’s stated position more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;National Constitutional Committee election&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was up to branch delegates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Constitutional Amendments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots to go through so Ann said we could just leave it to delegate’s
judgement. Ann’s recommendations in
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2017-09-08-amm/rulechanges.docx"&gt;her report&lt;/a&gt; were available. The floor
thanked Ann for her work. One person wanted us to take a position on
the McDonnell Amendment. May not come to a vote and instead be pushed
towards other reforms. This was defeated by small margin. Ann a bit
irritated that a lot of people voting to leave things to the delegates
last time wanted all of the debated (hence prompting her to go to the
effort of putting together a large document).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motion on Hate Crimes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increase in hate crimes over last year, especially towards
Muslims. Women afraid to go out. Oxford East motion to bring back
Commission of Racial Equality with authority to investigate hate
crimes. Passed with overwhelming support and no extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Minutes of Executive Committee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have minutes of
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2017-09-08-amm/exec-meeting-minutes.docx"&gt;July executive committee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next meeting October 13 with delegates reporting back from conference.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Labour Party"></category><category term="British Politics"></category><category term="Meetings"></category></entry><entry><title>On Climate Change, Ashton Beats Corbyn</title><link href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/on-climate-change-ashton-beats-corbyn.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-29T11:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-07-29T11:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>C.

There is now wide-spread knowledge of the Labour Party’s recent left
turn under leader Jeremy Corbyn in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and its surprising success
in recent elections. This, coupled with the even more surprising rise
of Bernie Sanders in the United States, opens the question of whether
something similar could happen in Canada. Cue
&lt;a href="http://www.nikiashton2017.ca/"&gt;Niki Ashton’s&lt;/a&gt; candidacy in the
ongoing federal leadership race of the New Democratic Party (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDP&lt;/span&gt;). As a
Canadian living in Britain I’ve followed her campaign with great
interest to see how it stacks up against the Corbyn project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area where I have been distinctly disappointed in Corbyn has been
on
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/attachments/ManifestoResponse.pdf"&gt;energy and climate policy&lt;/a&gt;.
Rather than argue for a rationally planned, publicly owned electricity
system, he has pandered to the current “progressive” fad of an energy
market made up of many small, competing renewable energy
generators. Instead of replacing the private energy suppliers, he has
opted to merely to add a public supplier to the market. While nuclear
energy is not rejected, it is clearly seen as secondary to renewable
energy and will also remain in the private sector. I have argued in
the past why renewable energy
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/a-21st-century-energy-policy-part-1-all-thats-wrong-with-renewables.html"&gt;will not be sufficient&lt;/a&gt; to power
Britain and why a
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/a-21st-century-energy-policy-part-4-the-institutions-to-make-it-happen.html"&gt;competitive energy market&lt;/a&gt; is an
obstacle to addressing climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, very little concrete is said by Labour about tackling
climate change. There is a commitment to have 65% clean energy by
2030, which is either an ambitious goal they have not developed policy
to meet or an extremely unambitious one stemming from a confusion of
“energy” and “electricity”. In the
&lt;a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/manifesto2017"&gt;election manifesto&lt;/a&gt;
there is some vague talk of home insulation and electrifying the
railways (although the latter was not discussed in an environmental
context), but otherwise nonelectric energy use is unaddressed. A
&lt;a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/page/-/PDFs/ONLINE%209756_17%20Richer%20Britain%2C%20Richer%20Lives%20%C2%AD%20Labour%C2%B9s%20Industrial%20Strate....pdf"&gt;supplementary document&lt;/a&gt;
mentions other technologies such as heat pumps, district heating,
carbon capture and storage, and electric vehicles but says little
about the type or scale of investments to be made in them, or how they
come together in a broader climate plan. Indeed, the need for a
comprehensive climate plan seems to be ignored, with a piecemeal
approach of disconnected commitments offered instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to Corbyn, Ashton has made
&lt;a href="http://www.nikiashton2017.ca/environmental-justice/"&gt;fighting climate change&lt;/a&gt;
a central feature of her campaign, rather than just one area to which
to direct stimulus funding. While not perfect, there is a lot about
her proposals which are very good. First and foremost, rather than
talk about tackling climate change in terms of sacrifices people will
have to make (as do many environmentalists), she does so by laying out
a positive vision of the country we want to live in. She describes how
her policies will bring better employment, housing, and
communities. She even extends this to workers in polluting industries,
sketching a framework which would see them usefully redeployed. This
is the sort of approach which will motivate people to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Niki Ashton campaign material calling for public sustainable energy sources." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/ashton-climate/publicEnergy.jpg"/&gt;
Unlike many liberal environmentalists, such as those in the Green
Party of Canada and its provincial affiliates, Ashton recognises the
role which the public sector must play in fighting climate change;
collective solutions are favoured over individual actions. Rather than
the usual emphasis on feed-in-tariffs and independent electricity
producers, she stresses that new energy infrastructure will be
public. Like Corbyn she calls for a public investment bank to fund
projects, but she goes further and proposes an additional crown
corporation&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; called Green Canada&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This entity would not only
assist in basic research in green technology, but commercialise and
manufacture it. It would&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accelerate pollution-fighting technology by funding open-source
research into solutions for the climate change challenges we face and
invest in public sector clean energy innovation. Every scenario for
avoiding runaway climate change includes a technological breakthrough
we don’t have yet. The public sector has an important role to play
in fostering innovation. Green Canada will partner with our public
universities to fund and carry out basic and applied research in
renewable energy and energy efficiency at dedicated new research
institutes. The rewards of research breakthroughs will be shared by
all of us: selected successful research will be the basis for new
manufacturing projects run directly by Green Canada. In time, this
crown corporation will grow into a complex green technology actor,
reinvesting funds into research, taking on strategic production tasks
that aid in meeting climate goals and providing the federal
government with streams of revenues for other needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exactly the sort of approach needed for decarbonisation. Just as
importantly, it reintroduces the idea of public ownership not simply
to run what is unprofitable, but for the purpose of economic
development and innovation. This pledge is honestly one of the most
exciting proposals I have seen from a politician in my lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other exciting aspect of Ashton’s proposals are the Green Canada
Advisory Boards. Four such boards would be created, working in
forestry, agriculture, fishing, and energy and made up of
representatives of workers, environmental experts, different levels of
government, industry, and indigenous people. Together they would
direct the operations of Green Canada and set best practices. One
advantage of such a system is that it would give workers in polluting
industries a say over how they are to be reformed or wound down. This
would make it easier to achieve buy-in for potentially controversial
reforms. More broadly, this would begin to provide democratic control
over public industry, something which has been missing from crown
corporations in the past. While Corbyn has paid lip-service to this
goal, Ashton has done more to spell out what it could look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashton’s pledges are a bit weaker when it comes to non-electric forms
of greenhouse gas (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GHG&lt;/span&gt;) emissions. Indeed, she currently lacks
a clear schedule for reductions, although a promise is made to convene
a group of experts for this purpose. Presumably the Green Canada
Advisory Boards for agriculture and forestry would be responsible for
addressing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GHG&lt;/span&gt; emissions from their respective sectors and from land
use change. Home heating is explicitly mentioned as an issue which
needs to be addressed, but more details could be provided. It would
also be good if district heating schemes were developed, given that
they fit well with Ashton’s emphasis on collective ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric vehicles are mentioned with a laudable emphasis on building
charging infrastructure, particularly on federal property such as post
offices. Unfortunately, no commitment is made to electrify the
government fleet of vehicles—creating a large initial
market for them—although this may have been an oversight.
Electrifying local public transit is another important issue which she
addresses. However, her goal of phasing out the sale of internal
combustion engines by 2040 is not ambitious enough. She also does not
address transport over longer distances, particularly of freight. We
need to electrify Canada’s railways and move goods off of roads and
onto trains. Ideally this would be achieved by nationalising the rail
companies and folding them into the public passenger operator, Via Rail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Niki Ashton campaign material calling for citizens, communities, and the public sector to fix climate change." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/ashton-climate/publicSector.jpg"/&gt;
My final concern is that Ashton seems intent on powering Canada using
only renewable energy. If this can even be done&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, it will almost certainly
require a significant build-out of new hydro dams. These are often
controversial, given that they flood large areas of land, and can lead
to conflicts with local aboriginal groups. Given Ashton’s (laudable)
championing of aboriginal issues and the Left’s opposition to the
Site C hydro damn in British Columbia, I’m not sure the will
would exist to pursue this. Hydro is also distributed very unevenly
across the country, meaning some provinces would become extremely
reliant on others for their electricity. I rather doubt this
would be well received, especially for those which would come to
depend on Quebec. Ideally, a renewable plan would see the creation of
a single national power company out of existing provincial ones, to
utilise hydro nation-wide. However, constitutionally this would
require all provinces to agree and I can’t see hydro-rich ones
(particularly Quebec) doing so. Indeed, such jurisdictional issues
will make it more difficult for the federal government to pursue any
green energy policy and Ashton does not address this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For provinces without much hydro and which want a degree of
self-sufficiency in electricity, the options are carbon capture and
storage or nuclear. Neither of these are mentioned in Ashton’s
proposals, although I was very pleased to see that they are not
explicitly ruled out either. My preference would be for nuclear, as
nuclear waste will likely be easier and cheaper to store than carbon
dioxide. Canada also has existing expertise in nuclear energy on which
to build, with over half of Ontario’s electricity coming from this
source. To this end, I would like to see Ashton commit to
renationalise &lt;a href="http://www.snclavalin.com/en/nuclear"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CANDU&lt;/span&gt; Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
and fold it into Green Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These criticisms aside, Ashton has laid out a very good initial
blueprint for fighting climate change. While more detail is needed on
some issues, this is only a policy proposal for party leadership and
it can be expected to undergo further development before a general
election. Despite this, in some areas it is already better developed
than the policies which the Labour Party ran on. Furthermore, unlike
Corbyn’s proposals, there are no fundamental problems with what Ashton
has put forward; any changes which I want to see made only involve
tweaking or expanding upon the framework already developed.  I
sincerely hope that these proposals will gain broad attention within
Canada and beyond. In particular, socialists and environmentalists in
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; would do well to take notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;Crown corporation” (or “crown corp”) is the Canadian term for a
state enterprise. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, despite fitting the usual naming scheme for federal
bodies, I must say is a horrible awkward name. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Britain, Canada has enough land that we can definitely
capture enough renewable energy to meet our needs. The problem is that
it
&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/4/7/15159034/100-renewable-energy-studies"&gt;remains unclear&lt;/a&gt;
if &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; country can provide a continuous, reliable electricity supply
using only renewable sources without massive hydro and geothermal
capacity. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

is the longer, original version. I have have also produced
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/attachments/PolicyStatement-Environment.pdf"&gt;another version of this report&lt;/a&gt;
which is more suited for use amending or replacing parts of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt;’s
document, taking into account comments received on my article. Thanks
you to David Pavett for his comments and suggestions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Policy Forum has made the strange decision to group
culture with the
&lt;a href="http://www.policyforum.labour.org.uk/agenda-2020/commissions/environment-energy-and-culture/npf-consultation-2017-environment-energy-and-culture?download=true"&gt;environment and energy&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile,
&lt;a href="http://www.policyforum.labour.org.uk/agenda-2020/commissions/housing-local-government-and-transport/npf-consultation-2017-housing-local-government-and-transport?download=true"&gt;transport&lt;/a&gt;
is placed, not completely without justification, with local government
and housing. However, as transport is a major consumer of energy and a
transport policy will be essential to fighting climate change, I
decided to address it along with energy and the environment, in place
of culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; document rightly identifies climate change as one of the
greatest challenges of the century. However, beyond this, it has
little to say. It refers to the Paris Agreement of 2015, but does not
acknowledge that the stated goal of keeping warming below 2°C, or
even 1.5°C,
&lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28663-paris-climate-deal-is-agreed-but-is-it-really-good-enough/"&gt;is not going to be achieved&lt;/a&gt;
with the emissions commitment which were made. Nor is the
&lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/3/23/15028480/roadmap-paris-climate-goals"&gt;magnitude of the challenge&lt;/a&gt;
of keeping temperatures below those limits recognised. It seems
inconceivable that it could be done without state-directed economic
planning on a scale previously unseen in the West during peacetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="figref-ukghg"&gt;&lt;img alt="ukghg::United Kingdom greenhouse gas emissions, 1990-1995. (Department of Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy, 7 February 2017)" src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/uk-ghg-emissions.png"/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt; United Kingdom greenhouse gas emissions, 1990-1995. (Department of Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy, 7 February 2017)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; believes that “Labour has a strong record in pressing for and
tackling climate change.” While it is true, as they say, that Labour
passed the Climate Change Act in 2008, this was
&lt;a href="https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081028/debtext/81028-0021.htm"&gt;also supported&lt;/a&gt;
by all but three of the Tories. The actual reductions in emissions
during Labour’s time in government were not much different from what
occurred under John Major and the Coalition (see Figure &lt;a href='#figref-ukghg'&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) and
did not come close to what is necessary. A recently published climate
plan required global emissions
&lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/3/23/15028480/roadmap-paris-climate-goals"&gt;to fall by half every decade&lt;/a&gt;
until at least 2050 and a developed country like Britain will be
required to making even faster cuts than that. If it is felt that this
is unachievable, then we need to be upfront about that and begin
preparing for the negative impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three omissions by this policy document should be noted. The first is
its failure to mention high-potency greenhouse gases such as methane,
nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. When weighted for global warming
potential, these make up
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589825/2015_Final_Emissions_statistics.pdf"&gt;nearly 20%&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; emissions, with methane being the most significant. Typically,
emissions of these gases are easier to prevent than those of carbon
dioxide, so rapid action should be taken to reduce them. Secondly, no
reference is made to the use of
“&lt;a href="http://roadtoparis.info/2015/03/30/will-negative-emissions-technology-get-us-to-2-degrees/"&gt;negative emissions&lt;/a&gt;”
technology, which most plans for combating climate change now
require. This involves planting trees, burning them, and sequestering
the released carbon underground. Finally, the effect of land use
changes (e.g. deforestation, conversion to agriculture) is not
mentioned, although at least
&lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/3/23/15028480/roadmap-paris-climate-goals"&gt;one climate plan&lt;/a&gt;
requires net emissions from this to reach zero by 2050. Overall, it
appears that the authors of this document know little about climate
change and have vastly underestimated the magnitude of the challenge
it now represents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; comes to suggesting actual policy is to commit
that “By investing £500 billion in infrastructure backed up by a
publicly owned National Investment Bank and regional banks we will
build a high-skilled, high tech, low carbon economy to help generate a
million good quality jobs.” Lacking any details of what sorts of
investments are involved, this pledge is useless. Where specific
sectors, such as energy, are mentioned, no solutions are proposed. In
the following sections, some priority sectors will be examined in
closer detail. In the following sections, some priority sectors will
be examined in closer detail and some broad policies put forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than once, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; comments on the importance of decarbonising
energy while at the same time tackling energy bills. The obvious
tension between wanting to “curb energy bill rises” while at the same
time invest in new energy infrastructure is never acknowledged. While
it is said that the “energy market is in need of reform”, what this
reform would look like is never stated. Indeed, the very existence of
a market in energy is never questioned; despite
&lt;a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/11/04/nationalise-energy-and-rail-companies-say-public/"&gt;widespread support&lt;/a&gt;
for renationalisation, the most the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; has to say on this issue is
calling for a “National Investment Bank to promote public investment
and community ownership across future energy solutions”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although acknowledging that “A fully costed low carbon energy platform
that includes renewables, nuclear and green gas should be developed
and publicly financed options should be considered to ensure that the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has a low carbon economy that works for consumers moving forwards”,
no effort has been taken to do this. As I have
&lt;a href="http://www.leftfutures.org/2017/02/energy-for-the-21st-century-part-i-fossil-fuels-renewables-and-nuclear/"&gt;argued elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;,
any realistic decarbonisation plan will need to rely heavily on
nuclear energy. Although this would be an unpopular proposition among
many on the left, we need to face up to
&lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c18/page_103.shtml"&gt;the impossibility&lt;/a&gt;
of powering Britain solely off of her own renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power can be most effectively deployed by the state using a
standardised design, adding another argument for nationalisation. A
similar argument could be made about renewable power sources. As I
have
&lt;a href="http://www.leftfutures.org/2017/02/a-21st-century-energy-policy-part-3-the-institutions-to-make-it-happen/"&gt;argued in the past&lt;/a&gt;,
a new Power Generation Board (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;) should be created out of existing
nuclear and renewable capacity and be given control over the national
grid. This would go some way to ending the absurdity which is the
market in electricity and would give the stability needed for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;
to make long-term investments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To eliminate fuel poverty, progressive tariffs could be used. This
would see every household given a minimum amount of electricity at low
or zero-cost, with the price per additional kilowatt-hour rising to
current levels and above depending on how much is used in a given
month. The price bands could be structured such that high-use
customers are effectively paying for the electricity of low-use
customers and this system would not be a cost to the
government. However, for this to work, all consumers would need to be
buying from the same electricity supplier. As such, supply and
distribution should also be nationalised and either folded in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;
or passed to a devolved body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little is said in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; document about non-electric energy use. As
electricity only represents
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589825/2015_Final_Emissions_statistics.pdf"&gt;29% of greenhouse-gas emissions&lt;/a&gt;,
this is a glaring omission. “Green gas” is mentioned and this could be
introduced into the gas supply as a short-term measure to reduce
emissions from heating. Some hydrogen could also be added and, if
appliances are converted, the gas supply could be switched entirely to
hydrogen. However for new houses (and, in the mid-term, for existing
ones), better energy efficiency can achieved using electric heat
pumps. Transport will also need to be electrified and this will be
discussed in more detail below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, nothing is said in the document about energy efficiency. All
new homes should be built to the highest standards of insulation and,
to the extent feasible, old homes should be retrofitted along these
lines. New home designs should try to maximise daylight and heat from
the sun. Even in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; document on housing, such things are not
considered. Appliances should be subject to strict efficiency
requirements and the government could create a program to buy old,
inefficient models back from citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Agriculture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agriculture is included in environmental policy, although the main
focus of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; draft seems to be on the issue of subsidies
post-Brexit. I will leave this issue to someone who knows more about
agricultural economics. However, it might be worth considering whether
a system of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_management_(Canada)"&gt;supply management&lt;/a&gt;
could replace subsidies. This would involve farmers selling to
marketing boards which they run in partnership with the state. The
marketing boards then operate a monopoly on wholesale and return any
profits to the farmers. For the overall system to be effective,
controls would be required on imports and exports of the managed
agricultural products, which may not be possible depending on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;’s
relationship with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agriculture is also a major source of greenhouse gases, making up
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589825/2015_Final_Emissions_statistics.pdf"&gt;10% of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;’s total&lt;/a&gt;. These
are mostly in the form of methane and nitrous oxide. The former is
produced in the digestive systems of livestock (particularly cattle)
while the latter comes from the use of fertilisers. While this is not
an area which I am greatly knowledgeable about, measures such as
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#agriculture"&gt;more precise application of fertiliser&lt;/a&gt;,
better soil management, different crop rotations, new animal
feeds, &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36315952"&gt;supplements to animal feeds, and breading&lt;/a&gt;
could all play a role. Any agricultural subsidies should be made
conditional on farmers taking action to reduce their emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transport&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only policies which can be found within the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; report on
transport are to take “the railways back into public ownership” and
“give local authorities franchising powers to run and manage their
local bus routes”. While the inadequacy and expense of public
transport are acknowledged, there are no concrete proposals to tackle either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rail&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the commitment to bring rail franchises back into public
ownership is laudable, there are many other questions to be answered
about rail. First, what is to happen to the Rolling Stock Companies
(ROSCOs) which lease the trains to the franchise operators? These are
&lt;a href="http://www.cresc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/GTR%20Report%20final%205%20June%202013.pdf"&gt;obscenely profitable&lt;/a&gt;,
take essentially no risk, and have failed to adequately invest in new
rolling stock. While nationalising franchises would cost essentially
nothing, the ROSCOs would be quite expensive. One approach would be
for the government to regulate them and trim the profit margins. Where
new rolling stock is introduced, it should be publicly owned. As
decarbonisation demands a campaign of rail electrification, plenty of
new stock will be required. It would be worth considering recreating
British Rail Engineering Limited to build this in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network Rail present another question. Currently it provides a hidden
subsidy to the train operators by charging
&lt;a href="http://www.cresc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/GTR%20Report%20final%205%20June%202013.pdf"&gt;artificially low track access fees&lt;/a&gt;. The
difference is made up by a government grant and borrowing. With each
infrastructure upgrade, its debt continues to
ballootheytheytheyn. While not sustainable, this has led to increased
investment compared to the days of British Rail, when funding was at
the whim of whoever was in government. A new model is clearly needed,
but what it should be is unclear. Furthermore, the question of exactly
&lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; new investments are needed in rail (e.g. electrification) needs
to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final consideration for rail is how a newly nationalised sector
should be structured. It
&lt;a href="http://www.redpepper.org.uk/getting-back-on-track-an-alternative-to-private-railways/"&gt;has been suggested&lt;/a&gt;
that the railways should be more decentralised than they were under
British Rail. Allowing large local authorities to manage commuter
rail, in the model of London Overground, does seem
reasonable. However, devolving regional rail services risks continuing
the fragmentation which has marked the sector since
privatisation. Perhaps a compromise would be to have trains operated
by a single national company but allow local and regional governments
to be represented in the administration of regional routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Buses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is welcome that the buses are acknowledged by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; and giving
local authorities more control over service is undoubtedly a good
idea. However, it is unclear what exactly is meant by “franchising
powers to run and manage their local bus routes”. Presumably it refers
to a system such as that in London where, even if a private company
operates the buses, they do so under contract with a local authority,
which sets and collects fares, determines routes, etc. Private
operators will
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/02/bus-battle-test-case-tyne-wear-privatisation"&gt;fight attempts&lt;/a&gt;
by local authorities to do this, so the process should be tilted in
favour of the councils. Additionally, funding should be provided by
central government to help buy or create council-owned bus
companies. There should also be an emphasis of integrating buses and
local transport with the rail system. Regional and national buses were
not mentioned by the report. These should also be re-regulated and,
preferably, taken back into public ownership. There may be a role for
devolved administrations to play in the management of these
services. New buses should be electric, either being trolley-buses or
battery powered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Public Transport&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No reference at all is made to other forms of transport. It is worth
considering whether current ferry services are adequate and whether
these should be brought back into the public sector. Ferry service
could be integrated with rail so as to provide a seamless alternative
to flying. Rationalising air routes would also go some way to reducing
emissions from aviation, suggesting that renationalisation of airports
and re-regulation of airlines should be on the table. It would be
worth considering whether a rail tunnel could be built to Ireland to
replace many flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A running theme through all of this has been the need to integrate
transport across jurisdictions and modes. This would make public
transit a more viable alternative to driving and flying. There is a
strong argument for making local transport free at the point of use,
to make it more accessible to those on low incomes and to encourage
use by everyone. Regional and national travel would still require
fares, but a single, simple ticketing system should be adopted across
the entire country for buses, trains, and ferries, allowing trips to
be planned and purchased in a single place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Private Vehicles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private transport goes completely unmentioned by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt;. While an
affordable and comprehensive mass transit system will go some way to
reducing the use of private automobiles, it obviously can not
eliminate it. A date should be set beyond which all cars sold in
Britain must be zero-emissions vehicles. For this to be practical, an
expansion in charging infrastructure is needed for electric cars. Fast
charging stations could be placed at existing petrol stations, while
(cheaper) slower ones could be placed in car-parks. A public
electrical company would be ideally placed to operate
these. Widespread adoption of electric vehicles would also be useful
in levelling out peaks in electricity demand, as owners could program
them to charge when demand is low (e.g. overnight) and, if necessary,
feed some of their energy back into the grid when demand is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is perhaps the greatest threat humanity has ever faced,
and mitigating it will be a task similar in scale to the conversion to
a wartime economy. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPF&lt;/span&gt; displays no awareness of this fact and has
made no effort to draw up the detailed plans which will be
required. Instead they have contented themselves with vague, feel-good
slogans while ignoring crucial areas of climate policy. If Britain and
the rest of the world continue to take such an approach, then climate
change will be a catastrophe and perhaps even an existential threat to
future generations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Energy"></category><category term="British Politics"></category><category term="Climate Change"></category><category term="Transport"></category><category term="Labour Party"></category></entry><entry><title>A 21st Century Energy Policy, Part 4: The Institutions to Make it Happen</title><link href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/a-21st-century-energy-policy-part-4-the-institutions-to-make-it-happen.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-29T09:03:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-01-29T09:03:00+00:00</updated><author><name>C.

framework capable of building the electricity infrastructure needed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="National Grid transmission lines in the over water meadows owned by the Oxford Preservation Trust. Source: Marion Phillips CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/energyPolicy/nationalGrid.jpg"/&gt;
As discussed in Part 3, the transition to a low-carbon economy is a
massive task which will require extensive government
intervention. During the most recent leadership campaign, Jeremy
Corbyn promised to “promote the growth of over 200 ‘local energy
companies’” and to “support the development of 1,000 community energy
co-operatives”. Although the exact meaning is unclear, presumably by
“local energy companies” he is referring to council-owned gas and
electricity distributors such as Nottingham’s
&lt;a href="https://robinhoodenergy.co.uk/"&gt;Robin Hood Energy&lt;/a&gt;. The “community
energy co-operatives” would appear to refer the small generators of
renewable electricity which can be found across Britain. The
&lt;a href="http://www.brightonenergy.org.uk/"&gt;Brighton Energy Co-operative&lt;/a&gt;
presents an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While placing electricity distribution in the hands of local authorities
may well be a good idea, it is important to consider what Corbyn’s
proposal actually involves. It is in no way, shape, or form
nationalisation of any part of the electricity industry. In Nottingham,
the physical infrastructure is owned by &lt;a href="http://www.westernpower.co.uk/Home.aspx"&gt;Western Power
Distribution&lt;/a&gt;, a subsidiary of
the American energy company &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPL&lt;/span&gt; Corporation. Nor do all Nottingham
residents purchase their electricity from the council; Robin Hood Energy
is simply one option along with the Big Six and other, smaller,
competitors. In fact, the way the energy market is currently regulated
means that Robin Hood Energy must offer to sell electricity and gas to
people all across Britain. Should such municipal companies become
wide-spread across the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, one would expect them to make inroads
against the Big Six, but remain only one set of players in the market.
This would not address the problems of money wasted on advertising,
promotions, and the bureaucracy needed to manage people changing suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there is almost nothing positive to be said about
energy co-operatives. In most sectors, a co-operative is owned by its
employees or its customers, but for energy this is not the case.
Instead, locals become members of the co-operative by &lt;a href="http://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/uploads/attachments/renewableenergy_0_0_0.pdf"&gt;paying to finance
new energy projects&lt;/a&gt;.
Given the way the energy market is structured in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, it is
impossible for them to then buy their power from the co-op. Instead, the
co-op sells its power to one of the energy supply companies and returns
the profits to its investors as dividends. These are generous dividends
at that: Brighton Energy Co-operative aims to make a &lt;a href="http://www.brightonenergy.org.uk/financial-benefits/"&gt;5% return on
investment each
year&lt;/a&gt;, which is
substantially higher than the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/uk"&gt;cost of servicing public-sector
borrowing&lt;/a&gt;.
Despite all their talk of “community ownership”, energy co-ops would
appear to have far more in common with Margaret Thatcher’s “share-owning
democracy” than with a socialist vision of society and are a far-cry
from Corbyn’s calls, early in his first leadership campaign, to
nationalise the energy companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Historical Energy Ownership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The CEGB logo. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CEGB.png" src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/energyPolicy/CEGB.png"/&gt; While the exact structure of the nationalised British electrical sector
changed somewhat under different post-war governments, it was broadly as
follows. The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228961/0315.pdf"&gt;Central Electricity Generating
Board&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEGB&lt;/span&gt;) owned all power plants and the national grid. The distribution
infrastructure (wires leading into people’s homes) was owned by 14 area
electricity boards. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEGB&lt;/span&gt; was responsible for ensuring that there was
always sufficient electricity supply for the country, which was bought
by the area electricity boards and then sold on to customers. Scotland
had a somewhat different structure to this, which is beyond the scope of
this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon privatisation, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEGB&lt;/span&gt; was split up into the national grid and
three generating companies. These were sold off over a few years,
along with the area electricity boards. Today, there are four
components to the
sector. &lt;a href="http://www2.nationalgrid.com/about-us/our-history/"&gt;National Grid plc&lt;/a&gt;
owns the high-voltage transmission lines and is the “system operator”
(turning power plants on and off to match supply and
demand). Similarly, in each region there will be a single company
owning and maintaining the
&lt;a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/electricity/distribution-networks/gb-electricity-distribution-network"&gt;distribution network&lt;/a&gt;.
Generation consists of various companies, ranging from giants like
&lt;a href="https://www.edfenergy.com/energy"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to small renewable
&lt;a href="http://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/uploads/attachments/renewableenergy_0_0_0.pdf"&gt;energy co-ops&lt;/a&gt;.
Finally, there are the supply companies that we all actually purchase
our electricity from. The
&lt;a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/electricity/retail-market/gb-electricity-retail-market"&gt;supply companies&lt;/a&gt;
purchase electricity on a
&lt;a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/electricity/wholesale-market/gb-electricity-wholesale-market"&gt;wholesale market&lt;/a&gt;
from various generating companies. &lt;!--Vertical integration is not allowed
in this system; a single company is not allowed to be both a generator
and a supplier. Needless to say, many companies get around this by
using different subsidiaries. Hence companies like SSE own power
plants, distribution networks, and energy suppliers.--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially upon nationalisation, gas was the responsibility of 12 &lt;a href="http://www.gasarchive.org/Nationalisation.htm"&gt;area
gas boards&lt;/a&gt;, with a
central Gas Council acting a a coordinator and liaison with the
government. In the 1970s these boards were merged in to the single
&lt;a href="http://www.gasarchive.org/BritishGasCorp.htm"&gt;British Gas Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.
Prior to privatisation, the Thatcher government required British Gas to
carry natural gas for other suppliers. Unlike electricity, gas was
privatised as a single unit, becoming &lt;a href="http://www.gasarchive.org/privatisation1.htm"&gt;British Gas
plc&lt;/a&gt;. A series of
restructurings and demergers followed, with the &lt;a href="http://www.gasarchive.org/privatisation2.htm"&gt;gas mains now owned by
National Grid plc&lt;/a&gt;.
Exploration, production, storage, and sale of gas is now performed by
various companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Ownership Structures of Tomorrow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for the past; what of the future? The three over-riding
requirements for a 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century electricity sector are to
produce energy cleanly, reliably, and as cheaply as possible. A Labour
government must act to ensure rapid decarbonisation of the electricity
supply, while at the same time increasing electricity production and
ensuring that the lights remain on. As all low-carbon sources of
electricity are capital-intensive and have slow return on investment, the
only way to make the private sector build it is to provide generous
fixed prices for the electricity. This is expensive, so it makes far
more sense to build these projects in the public sector, especially
given the low interest rates at which a government can borrow. Thus,
public ownership is a practical policy in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A newly-created Power Generation Board (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;) would be given a strict and
aggressive time-table to build new infrastructure with which to
decarbonise Britain’s electricity supply and begin replacing
non-electric energy sources. The exact details of how this would be
achieved are a technical matter best addressed by experts. However,
for reasons discussed in earlier sections, it seem clear that nuclear
power will have to play a major part in any sustainable energy mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The logo for former state enterprise British Nuclear Fuels Limited." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/energyPolicy/BNFL.png"/&gt;
Nuclear power is cheapest when built by a public sector with
capacities for economic planning and direction, as was the case for
France in the 1970s. Currently Britain lacks such capacities. To begin
to regain them, measures should be taken to concentrate nuclear
expertise in the state.  One important step in this direction would be
nationalising the existing nuclear power plants, to be placed in the
hands of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;. Furthermore, an additional state enterprise, in the
vein of the old
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nuclear_Fuels_Ltd"&gt;British Nuclear Fuels Limited&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BNFL&lt;/span&gt;), should be created and tasked with developing new reactor
designs, advising the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;, decommissioning old reactors, proposing new
fuel cycles, examining issues around waste, etc. Initially, it would
be formed out of the existing
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/nuclear-decommissioning-authority"&gt;Nuclear Decommissioning Authority&lt;/a&gt;,
with all outsourced operations brought back in-house, and the
&lt;a href="http://www.nnl.co.uk/"&gt;National Nuclear Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;. The Office for
Nuclear Regulation (“Ofnuke”) would remain strictly independent from
both this enterprise and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;. Britain should support international
cooperation and research in the nuclear sector and, contrary to
current Conservative plans, remain a member of
&lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/euratom/index_en.cfm"&gt;Euratom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the cost of government borrowing is lower than the returns
expected by private (even co-operative) electricity producers, it would
also make sense to nationalise the existing renewable infrastructure. As in
the case of nationalising nuclear reactors, this has the further
advantaging of bringing expertise into the public sector. On the other
hand, given that fossil fuel assets are to be phased out as rapidly as
possible, it would likely be better to leave most of these in the
private sector and avoid the public having to pay decommissioning costs.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt; would act as a single purchaser (monopsony) for all
privately-produced electricity, which would provide an effective form of
public control over this sector. In order to ensure that pressure to cut
electricity costs does not lead to poorer pay or working conditions in
the private companies, sectoral collective bargaining should be used. In
the event that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt; deems the cost of purchasing electricity
privately is greater than the cost of nationalising the producer, the
producer should be taken into public ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such an arrangement would require a radical change to current
regulations. At a minimum, distribution companies must be prohibited
from purchasing electricity from anyone other than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;, in order to
ensure that low-carbon electricity is being used. Given this, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;
should take over the role of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_system_operator"&gt;transmission system
operator&lt;/a&gt;
from National Grid plc. Ideally, the transmission infrastructure itself
would also be nationalised, although this is not strictly necessary for
the energy transition described here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monopoly in generation also means there is little point in having
competing distribution companies selling electricity to customers or
in separating them from the distribution networks. In the event of
devolution to the English regions, a tidy approach would be to require
each of them (along with Scotland and Wales) to maintain an
electricity board to operate the distribution infrastructure and be
the monopoly supplier of power to consumers. It would also be possible
to have local authorities play this roll. In either case, it should be
illegal for them to reprivatise these assets. Alternatively, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;
could perform this role too, forming a fully vertically-integrated
utility. While this might achieve greater economy of scale and such a
move was
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228961/0315.pdf"&gt;recommended in the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;,
it does somewhat cut against the present zeitgeist for localism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nationalisation Costs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be a cost of nationalising the electricity transmission and
distribution networks. This might lead some to argue that a Labour
government should hold off on such actions. However, it makes more sense
to structure the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt; and any newly-created public distributors to be
able to operate these assets from the start rather than have to
reorganise them later. Additionally, the cost of servicing any debt
incurred would almost certainly be less than the cost of paying to use
these networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it has been claimed that nationalising the energy sector would
cost an eye-watering
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/07/jeremy-corbyns-bill-nationalising-energy-sector-185bn"&gt;£185 billion&lt;/a&gt;,
this number is flawed as it assumes compensation would be paid at
full-market rates and that overseas assets would also be purchased.
&lt;a href="http://www.psiru.org/sites/default/files/2016-04-E-UK-public.pdf"&gt;Another report&lt;/a&gt;
argued that compensation could be provided only at the value of a
company’s equity, making nationalising Britain’s electricity
transmission and distribution infrastructure cost £8.4
billion&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Nationalising all of the Big 6 would cost £44.4
billion. However, there is no need to expropriate their supply
businesses—these would simply become obsolete with the introduction
of publicly-owned ones. As stated above, fossil fuel power plants
would be left in the private sector—at least initially. Given that
all of these companies have diverse energy portfolios, the cost of
nationalising just nuclear and renewable generation can only be
estimated. The Big 6 make up
&lt;a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/chart/wholesale-electricity-generation-market-shares-company-2015-gb"&gt;about 70%&lt;/a&gt;
of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; generation market. If all of their equity is in this portion
of of their business, then the equity-value of the entire generation
sector is about £63.4 billion. Nuclear and renewable sources supply
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/513244/Press_Notice_March_2016.pdf"&gt;about 45%&lt;/a&gt;
of Britain’s electricity, so the cost of nationalising this
infrastructure should be about £30 billion. It must be stressed that
this is an extremely pessimistic number, as it assumes all equity is
tied up in generation infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As gas should be phased out and replaced with electricity, there is
little point in nationalising this side of the energy industry. Should
some other use be found for parts of the gas network (e.g. transporting
hydrogen or providing district heating) then the relevant portions of it
should be brought into public ownership. The supply-side of this
industry could either be regulated or this role could be performed in
the public sector, e.g. by councils or the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;European Energy Directives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above represents an idealised scenario for energy ownership.
However, it is in radical violation of current &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/energy/node/50"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; energy
policy&lt;/a&gt;. This policy requires an
open market, unbundling of electricity distribution from generation, and
regulators independent from government. During Brexit negotiations,
Britain should strive to avoid being bound by these directives. Should
this prove unsuccessful, then there are two options: knowingly
disobeying the directives or adapting the above strategy to lie within them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could this plan be sufficiently adapted? The following components would
not be possible: integrating the system operator into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;, requiring
all electricity to be purchased from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;, permitting private
generators only to sell to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;, and creating a public monopoly in supply.
It would still be possible to have the system operator in the public
sector and to direct it to prefer clean energy sources over fossil
fuels, so long as it in no way favoured the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGB&lt;/span&gt;. It would also be
possible to require a certain portion of electricity purchased by
private suppliers to be clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should an electricity wholesale market remain in any form, it will
likely make investment in new energy sources more difficult. All
low-carbon electricity has high capital costs but low operating costs.
This means that investment only makes sense if future electricity prices
are known. When electricity is produced by a single
vertically-integrated supplier this is the default position, but not so
in a market where the wholesale price fluctuates on an hourly basis. The
existence of multiple suppliers is also problematic, as it would prevent
more direct means of controlling price and tariff structures.
Inefficiencies associated with having multiple suppliers, such as
marketing and promotional deals, would persist. If Britain chooses to
stick to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; energy regulations, then we will have to content
ourselves with much less direct means of influencing the energy system
and the possibility that companies will be able to exploit loopholes or
sabotage government plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most concerning of all, European officials &lt;a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/commission-set-for-climb-down-on-ownership-unbundling/"&gt;have
indicated&lt;/a&gt;
that state-backed investment and regulated prices (as done during
France’s past build-out of nuclear reactors) would violate state-aid
rules. As that is the model set forth here for Britain, this is very
worrying. This must be the ultimate red-line. Without this
form of state-aid, decarbonisation is all but impossible. Whatever is
decided with regards to the existence of an electricity market, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;
must be willing to violate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; rules on state aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy policy is a highly technical matter involving politics,
economics, engineering, fundamental physics, and law. Books can, and
have, been written on these matters, so this series of articles can
only provide an overview of the issues. As has been seen, transition
to a low carbon economy will not be easy and will not be possible
using only (or even mainly) renewable energy. Nuclear power must play
a role. The sort of transition described here will require not only
active state intervention in the energy sector, but in many other
parts of the economy as well. A Labour government intent on protecting
the environment must be prepared for the magnitude of the task and be
willing to violate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; directives in order to achieve it. To paraphrase
a cliché, the choice before us is clear: socialism or environmental disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower value of £7.5 billion quoted in the report seemed to assume that money would &lt;em&gt;be paid to the government&lt;/em&gt; when nationalising those distribution companies with negative equity. This seems unlikely—the best we could hope for in those cases is not to have to pay any compensation. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

policy for the left-wing Labour-supporting website
&lt;a href="http://www.leftfutures.org/"&gt;Left Futures&lt;/a&gt;. In

advocates for the role of nuclear power in an energy
transition. Various technologies which should be used and policies
which should be enacted in order to improve energy efficiency and
electrify heat and transport are discussed in
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/a-21st-century-energy-policy-part-3-the-technology-of-the-future.html"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;. Finally,
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/a-21st-century-energy-policy-part-4-the-institutions-to-make-it-happen.html"&gt;Part 4&lt;/a&gt; proposes an ownership
framework capable of building the electricity infrastructure needed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If humanity is to have any hope of avoiding catastrophic climate
change, developed countries must take aggressive steps to decarbonise
as quickly as possible. This will mean not only replacing existing
fossil-fuel power plants, but greatly expanding all electricity
production to replace gas and petrol. Such a task demands not just an
energy policy, but a
&lt;a href="http://www.leftfutures.org/2017/01/a-left-economic-strategy-for-labour-putting-meat-on-the-bones/comment-page-1/"&gt;comprehensive economic plan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons discussed in Part 1, decarbonisation is not achievable
using only renewable sources. Investments should certainly be made in
wind, and (where feasible) hydroelectric, tidal, and geothermal power,
but even combined these are unlikely to provide more than half of the
current supply. The remainder must be made up by nuclear power. This
is broadly in line with what energy analyst David MacKay proposed as
“&lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c27/page_211.shtml"&gt;Plan E&lt;/a&gt;” in his
book
&lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/Contents.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sustainable Energy—Without the Hot Air&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This
was the plan which he deemed to be the most economical of those he proposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="*Sustainable Energy--Without the Hot Air*, by David MacKay, offers an extremely detailed examination of how energy is used, how it can be conserved, and how it can be produced." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/energyPolicy/withoutHotAir.jpg"/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sustainable Energy—Without the Hot Air&lt;/em&gt;, by David MacKay, offers an extremely detailed examination of how energy is used, how it can be conserved, and how it can be produced.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve cost effectiveness, new nuclear reactors should be built to
a standard design, perhaps initially an established one with known
costs; the spiralling costs at Hinkley C (which
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/18/we-are-pro-nuclear-but-hinkley-c-must-be-scrapped"&gt;should probably be cancelled&lt;/a&gt;)
show what can happen when a new and untested design is used. Such a
strategy is similar to the mass build-out of nuclear reactors in
France during the 1970s and 80s. Unfortunately, Britain today lacks
the capacity for state-directed economic development which France had
at that time. Steps to regain it will be discussed in Part 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-consumption-in-the-uk"&gt;statistics provided by the Department of Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy&lt;/a&gt;,
currently electricity makes up about 20% of Britain’s energy usage,
while gas accounts for about 30% and petroleum products for almost all
of the rest. Gas and petrol will need to be phased out, as they can
not be decarbonised. When faced with these numbers, the scale of the
task ahead becomes apparent; not only must the majority of the
existing electricity supply be replaced, but it must be expanded
several times over. Fortunately, there is much which can be done to
improve efficiency, somewhat reducing the amount of new capacity needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures such as insulation could realistically result in a
&lt;a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Next-steps-for-UK-heat-policy-Committee-on-Climate-Change-October-2016.pdf"&gt;reduction of 15%&lt;/a&gt;
in energy used for heating existing buildings by 2030. Obviously, new
buildings should be required to meet high efficiency standards.
Old and inefficient boilers could be replaced, although the phasing out of gas might mean that this is not worthwhile. The question then emerges as to
how to achieve the upgrading of old buildings. The Green Party has, in
the past, proposed that households should simply be given the
insulation for free. However, this amounts to little more than a gift
to those well-off enough to own their house or a gift to
landlords. The government could offer to finance insulation at a rate
where the cost would be covered by savings in gas bills. However,
landlords would have to be permitted to increase rents accordingly for
this to provide them with an incentive.  Further discussion will be
needed on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various options exist to replace gas for heat and hot water. The
simplest would be electric baseboard heating and immersion heating,
which are a well-established technologies with cheap up-front
costs. The upfront costs for these are relatively cheap, although
still significant. In
&lt;a href="http://nbpower.ca/en/products-services/water-heaters/your-options"&gt;parts of Canada&lt;/a&gt;
most people rent their water heaters from the power company and a
similar option could be pursued here. Note, however, that with the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;’s present electricity supply, this form is heating is actually
&lt;a href="http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/renewable-energy/heat/air-source-heat-pumps"&gt;worse for the environment&lt;/a&gt;
than gas, so it should only be rolled out after substantial
electricity decarbonisation.
&lt;a href="http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/renewable-energy/heat/air-source-heat-pumps"&gt;Heat&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/renewable-energy/heat/ground-source-heat-pumps"&gt;pumps&lt;/a&gt;
offer a few times better energy efficiency than conventional electric
heating but have very high up-front costs. Mass producing heat pumps,
in order to bring down the price, should be one aim of national
industrial policy and the government should also offer to finance
their installation or allow customers to rent them from the power
company. &lt;a href="http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/renewable-energy/heat/solar-water-heating"&gt;Solar thermal&lt;/a&gt;
panels can be coupled with these systems to help provide hot water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In areas with sufficiently high population density, district heating
should likely play a substantial role. Where practical, this should
use waste heat from power plants. This
&lt;a href="http://www.cwh.org.uk/assets/_files/documents/oct_13/CITY__1382345517_Factsheetfinal2013.pdf"&gt;was done in Westminster&lt;/a&gt;
with the old Battersea Power Station. A publicly owned electricity
company should build such systems around any nuclear or geothermal
power plants, possibly in partnership with local authorities. Heat can
also be extracted from
&lt;a href="http://enwave.com/locations/toronto/"&gt;large bodies of water&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/neighbourhood-energy-strategy.aspx"&gt;sewage&lt;/a&gt;,
and the ground using heat pumps. The government should offer loans to
councils which wish to invest in such projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--![District heating accumulator tower in Westminster. Source: Fin Fahey at the English language Wikipedia, [CC-BY-SA-2.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/deed.en), via Wikimedia Commons]({filename}/images/energyPolicy/heatingTower.jpg)--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binding efficiency requirements must be set for consumer and
industrial goods and these should be regularly updated. A government
program to purchase older white-goods, similar to Obama’s
“&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_Allowance_Rebate_System"&gt;cash for clunkers&lt;/a&gt;”
program, could be used to incentivise upgrading to more
energy-efficient models. A similar approach could be taken with other
goods such a televisions and light-bulbs. Gas ovens and hobs will
eventually become obsolete and need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concerted effort should be made to shift people out of cars and onto
public transit. One step in this direction would be
&lt;a href="https://farefreepublictransport.com/"&gt;free public transit&lt;/a&gt;. Congestion
charges, pedestrian zones, road tolls, and reduced speed limits can
all be used to discourage car use. Cycling routes and infrastructure
should be improved. 100% electrification should be a goal for railways
and some of the routes closed under the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeching_cuts"&gt;Beeching Axe&lt;/a&gt; of the
1960s should be considered for reopening. The current bus fleet should
be gradually replaced by trolleys, trolley-buses, and battery-powered
buses. This will be more difficult for long-distance buses, as
batteries have limited range and it may be impractical to run wires
over the long stretches of highway.  To the extent that private
vehicles continue to be used, they will have to be electric and
government action will be needed to develop the charging
infrastructure. Long-distance freight should increasingly be
transported by rail and local freight by electric trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long distance travel by air or sea is more difficult as there are no
nearby electrical wires to power it. The energy density of batteries
is
&lt;a href="https://carboncounter.wordpress.com/2015/06/18/flying-without-fossil-fuels-the-need-for-high-energy-density/"&gt;only a few percent of diesel or jet fuel&lt;/a&gt;,
making it impossible to fit enough of them on a ship or plane to power
a voyage. Alternatives such as biofuels or hydrogen are still decades
away and, in the case of the former, there are concerns about them
displacing essential food production. In the meantime, rail should
start to replace short-haul aviation, particularly for domestic
flights. Various
&lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/5/6/11569202/aviation-emissions-solar-plane"&gt;incremental improvements&lt;/a&gt;
can be made to reduce energy use by planes. Research into alternatives
to jet fuel should be continued and expanded. Shipping remains quite
energy efficient and thus is not an initial priority for
decarbonisation but, in addition to developing biofuels, the government could look to develop
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_marine_propulsion"&gt;nuclear powered freighters&lt;/a&gt;
similar to the nuclear powered aircraft carriers, submarines, and ice
breakers which already exist. Some of the same safety measures could be used as when &lt;a href="http://www.pntl.co.uk/safety/"&gt;transporting nuclear waste by ship&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="The NS Savannah, the first nuclear powered merchant vessel. It was largely experimental and suffered design issues unrelated to its engine.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note, there are also various non-energy related sources of
greenhouse gases. Particular culprits are
&lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c13/page_76.shtml"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt; and the
&lt;a href="https://carboncounter.wordpress.com/2015/06/11/can-you-make-a-wind-turbine-without-fossil-fuels-2/"&gt;manufacture of steel and cement&lt;/a&gt;.
These issues are beyond the scope of these articles, but it should be
noted that they are not easy to solve. Furthermore, at present the
greenhouse gases emitted in the production of Britain’s imports
&lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c15/page_93.shtml"&gt;are almost equal&lt;/a&gt; to
those of Britain itself. Rebuilding Britain’s manufacturing sector
will help with this, but ultimately it represents the need for
international action to fight climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen, the task of moving Britain over to a low-carbon
economy is a Herculean one. It will require government intervention on
an unprecedented scale. Only a left-wing government, armed with a
detailed and carefully worked-out economic plan, can hope to achieve
it in an equitable manner.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Energy"></category><category term="British Politics"></category><category term="Nuclear Power"></category><category term="Heating"></category><category term="Transport"></category><category term="Climate Change"></category></entry><entry><title>A 21st Century Energy Policy, Part 2: Nuclear Powered Socialism</title><link href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/a-21st-century-energy-policy-part-2-nuclear-powered-socialism.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-29T09:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-01-29T09:01:00+00:00</updated><author><name>C.

advocates for the role of nuclear power in an energy
transition. Various technologies which should be used and policies
which should be enacted in order to improve energy efficiency and
electrify heat and transport are discussed in
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/a-21st-century-energy-policy-part-3-the-technology-of-the-future.html"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;. Finally,
&lt;a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/a-21st-century-energy-policy-part-4-the-institutions-to-make-it-happen.html"&gt;Part 4&lt;/a&gt; proposes an ownership
framework capable of building the electricity infrastructure needed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described in the previous article, renewable energy will not be
able to provide the backbone of Britain’s electricity
supply. Geothermal power might provide a minority of the baseload
capacity, it may be worth building new hydroelectric dams where
possible, and there is a place for some intermittent energy capacity,
but this still requires a substantial portion of the supply to come
from another source. If fossil fuels must be abandoned&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and
renewable energy isn’t up for the task, that leaves nuclear
power. Nuclear power is, today, almost universally reviled by the left
(with the notable exception of the Communist Party of France).  It is
viewed as dirty, dangerous, and expensive. The truth is, it need be
none of these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the fear around nuclear power comes from not understanding the
science and risks of radiation. It is notable that scientists tend
&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3700115"&gt;not to be afraid of radiation&lt;/a&gt;
and are
&lt;a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/"&gt;significantly more in favour&lt;/a&gt;
of building nuclear power plants than the general population. The fact
of the matter is that the extra radiation experienced by people living
near a nuclear power plant is insignificant in comparison to
background radiation, as can be seen in the chart below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Radiation doses experienced from every-day activity, compared to those from nuclear accident and doses which are actually dangerous. Source: Randall Munroe, XKCD (follow link for larger image)." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/energyPolicy/radiation.png"/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Radiation doses experienced from every-day activity, compared to those from nuclear accident and doses which are actually dangerous. Source: Randall Munroe, &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/radiation/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XKCD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (follow link for larger image).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat of accidents has also been greatly overblown. The major
accidents which are cited are Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and
Fukushima. The
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident#Health_effects_and_epidemiology"&gt;consensus among peer-reviewed studies&lt;/a&gt;
is that the Three Mile Island accident led to few or no deaths. The
&lt;a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html"&gt;causes of the accident&lt;/a&gt;
have been thoroughly investigated and reactor design and operating
procedures have been improved as a result. Chernobyl, far and away the worst of these incidents,
&lt;a href="http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub913e_web.pdf"&gt;was the fault of&lt;/a&gt;
a uniquely bad reactor design and a poorly executed experiment. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RBMK&lt;/span&gt;
reactors, such as the one at Chernobyl, are known to be unstable, had
a control rod design which initially &lt;em&gt;increases&lt;/em&gt; the reaction rate,
are surrounded by flammable graphite, and lack the containment
buildings seen in all other nuclear power plants. An accident like
that at Chernobyl would not be physically possible in the types of
reactors used in the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fukushima is the most recent of these and has resulted in a renewed
backlash against nuclear power. It is important to remember that this
event was initiated by an a 13m-15m tsunami resulting from a magnitude
9 earthquake,
&lt;a href="http://earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/research/events/tohoku/BritishTsunami.html"&gt;neither of which are events which can strike Britain&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore,
the private operator &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TEPCO&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006070548/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/world/asia/tepco-admits-failure-in-acknowledging-risks-at-nuclear-plant.html?_r=0"&gt;had been&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005004918/http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/2012/10/12/japan-utility-admits-nuke-crisis-avoidable-says-feared-consequences-new-safety-measures/NK3yENYHgVPQZ76POvbBLL/story.html"&gt;cutting corners&lt;/a&gt;
in terms of disaster preparedness. Clearly, strong independent
oversight is needed for nuclear power and reactors should be in public
ownership to make corner-cutting less likely. However, Fukushima is
not an indictment of nuclear energy &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. No one died from
radiation poisoning and any increase in cancer deaths looks
&lt;a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/fukushima_report_20130228/en/"&gt;set to be very small&lt;/a&gt;
(even when using pessimistic models) and difficult to separate from
background rates. As with Chernobyl,
&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/fukushima-fallout-of-fear-1.12194"&gt;mental illness&lt;/a&gt;
is a bigger threat to the effected population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously every death is tragic, but
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/21/pro-nuclear-japan-fukushima"&gt;no energy source is without risks&lt;/a&gt;.
Despite its scary reputation, nuclear power has the
&lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c24/page_168.shtml"&gt;lowest or second lowest number of deaths per gigawatt-hour&lt;/a&gt;
of any energy source. When things go wrong, they tend to do so in a
big, scary way, which misleads people as to the threat. New reactor
designs (and, indeed, some older ones such as the
&lt;a href="http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#q"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CANDU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) include “passive
safety” features which do not depend on human or electronic
intervention, making accidents like those at Three Mile Island,
Chernobyl, and Fukushima physically impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big argument against nuclear power is what to do with the
waste. It is important to keep this problem in perspective. Currently,
only
&lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c24/page_170.shtml"&gt;25ml of high level nuclear waste&lt;/a&gt;
(the stuff which needs to be stored for thousands of years) is
produced per person, per year in Britain. Even if all of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;’s
present energy demands were met by nuclear, it would produce about a
pint of high level waste per person, per year. This is a small volume
to deal with when compared to other forms of waste. We can keep the
waste in &lt;a href="http://www.pntl.co.uk/safety/packages/"&gt;dry cask storage&lt;/a&gt;
indefinitely as we look for longer-term solutions, so unlike &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GHG&lt;/span&gt;
emissions this is not a pressing issue. Ultimately,
&lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/pdf/waste_disposal_en.pdf"&gt;burying nuclear waste&lt;/a&gt;
deep in dry, geologically stable regions looks to be a viable
solution. Furthermore,
&lt;a href="https://www.gen-4.org/gif/jcms/c_59461/generation-iv-systems"&gt;Generation &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
reactor designs promise to be able to use existing nuclear waste as
fuel and produce much lower volumes of their own waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no denying that many nuclear projects have been
expensive. New reactor designs have been known to go over-budget. On
the other hand, while results of studies examining energy costs vary
greatly
(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source"&gt;see the Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;),
they tend to show that overall nuclear is of comparable cost to other
energy sources. In recent years it can appear that renewable energy is
cheaper, but these studies do not seem to take into account
requirements for storage and changes to the electricity grid. Nuclear
power plants have large capital costs and low operating costs, which
means that building them in the private sector requires expensive
subsidies. Nuclear-dependent France has
&lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Electricity_prices_for_household_consumers,_second_half_2015_(¹)_(EUR_per_kWh)_YB16.png"&gt;middling&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25200808"&gt;low&lt;/a&gt; electricity
costs and demonstrates the savings which can be achieved by building
reactors through a public sector energy monopoly to a standard
design. In the future,
&lt;a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/3-ways-small-modular-reactors-overcome-existing-barriers-to-nuclear/"&gt;small modular reactors&lt;/a&gt;
could potentially be mass-produced, bringing prices down
further. While no clean energy source is cheap, nuclear is likely to
be the cheapest option for countries without hydroelectric or
geothermal capacity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most leftists are today opposed to nuclear energy, ironically it
is only within a left-wing
&lt;a href="http://www.leftfutures.org/2017/01/a-left-economic-strategy-for-labour-putting-meat-on-the-bones/comment-page-1/"&gt;comprehensive economic plan&lt;/a&gt;
that nuclear power can reach its full potential. The energy transition
of
&lt;a href="http://www.iea.org/stats/WebGraphs/FRANCE2.pdf"&gt;France in the 1970s and 1980s&lt;/a&gt;
shows what can be achieved by a state intent on transforming its power
supply. For a country to prosper, it must have a clean, reliable,
abundant energy supply and renewables alone will not provide this in
Britain. If socialism is to bring prosperity, rather than a more
equitable distribution of misery, our socialism must be nuclear powered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon capture and storage (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCS&lt;/span&gt;) technology is sometimes invoked as a way for us to continue using fossil fuels. The issue with it is how we go about ensuring that the captured &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;em&gt;stays where we put it&lt;/em&gt;. Usually it is suggested that it be stored underground, but were it to leak then it would undo all of our work capturing it in the first place. In many ways this is a more concerning problem even than nuclear waste, since the latter is solid—making it much easier to contain than a gas—and needs to be stored for only a finite time. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

framework capable of building the electricity infrastructure needed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of Arthur Scargill, most on the Left agree that the
days of fossil fuels must soon come to an end. Whatever nostalgia some
may have for the Miner’s Strike, we all know that it would be
environmental catastrophe to revive the coal industry. But if we are
to wean ourselves off of coal and other fossil fuels, what will take
their place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer which springs to everyone’s lips is “renewable energy”.
Jeremy Corby has promised to have
&lt;a href="http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/energy"&gt;65% of electricity&lt;/a&gt; coming
from renewable sources by 2030, with a longer term goal of 85%. There
is also a promise to phase out coal power plants by the early 2020s,
strive to keep 80% of global fossil fuel reserves in the ground, and
create 300 000 jobs in the renewable energy supply chain. All of this
chimes well with the calls for a
&lt;a href="http://www.greennewdealgroup.org/"&gt;Green New Deal&lt;/a&gt; which have been
coming from progressives since the financial crisis of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="The Scroby Sands Wind Farm which produces, on average, less than 20MW of power.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are two problems. First, it’s not enough. Given that there are
some sectors (such as agriculture, steel, and concrete production) which
would be difficult or impossible to decarbonise, we must have greater
reductions in greenhouse gas (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GHG&lt;/span&gt;) emissions from electricity than 65,
or even 85, percent. Ultimately, it will need to be 100% and it will
need to be achieved as quickly as possible. Second of all, even a target
of 65% renewable electricity is not achievable for Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the following types of renewable energy have found extensive
use: hydroelectric, wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. Of these,
hydro, geothermal, and biomass energy are able to provide stable,
base-load energy supplies. Hydro-power is the best-established of these
technologies and provides the vast majority of electricity in Norway and
parts of Canada. However, it requires specific geographical features to
be viable. As such, only a &lt;a href="http://www.british-hydro.org/UK%20Hydro%20Resource/England%20and%20Wales%20Resource%20Study%20Oct%202010.pdf"&gt;few hundred
megawatts&lt;/a&gt;
of new hydro capacity could be built in England and Wales. Scotland has
somewhat more potential, with a &lt;a href="http://www.british-hydro.org/UK%20Hydro%20Resource/Scottish%20Hydro%20Resource%20Study%20Aug%202008.pdf"&gt;few
gigawatts&lt;/a&gt;
of new capacity possible, but only a fraction of this would be viable in
practice. Furthermore, it is still only a few percent of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129501.900-electricity-use-drops-as-uk-passes-peak-light-bulb/"&gt;50-60
gigawatt peak power
consumption&lt;/a&gt;.
The role of geothermal energy in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is unclear: a renewable industry
group estimates that it could provide up to &lt;a href="http://www.r-e-a.net/news/deep-geothermal-resource-has-potential-to-produce-up-to-20-of-uk-electricity-and-heat-for-millions"&gt;20% of the country’s
current electricity
needs&lt;/a&gt;
and be used very effectively to heat homes, while others have suggested
that it is an &lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c16/page_98.shtml"&gt;impractical power
source&lt;/a&gt; for Britain.
Even in the former case, however, other energy sources will be needed.
Biomass power (largely consisting of burning wood-chips) is expensive
and of dubious environmental benefit. While it is claimed to be “carbon
neutral”, &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2114993-europes-green-energy-policy-is-a-disaster-for-the-environment/"&gt;this is
untrue&lt;/a&gt;
on the time scales relevant to mitigating global warming. In fact, it
can release more GHGs than fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves solar power and wind. Given the relatively high latitude
of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, general cloudiness, and fact that energy consumption is
highest at the times of day and year with the least sunlight,
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/01/solar-panel-feed-in-tariff"&gt;solar panels are massively unfit&lt;/a&gt;
as an energy source in this country. Furthermore, solar and wind are
known as &lt;em&gt;intermittent&lt;/em&gt; energy sources, as their output varies, often
in an unpredictable manner. This makes them considerably more
difficult to manage than conventional power plants. In an electricity
system with other energy sources that can be turned on and off,
intermittent energy sources could provide a significant minority of
the supply. However, as their share grows, you begin to run the risk
of brownouts. Thus, it becomes necessary to both build excess
generating capacity and to build storage capacity. This way, when the
sun is shining and the wind is blowing, some of the energy can be set
aside for when it’s dark and calm. Unfortunately, at present, we
&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914010290"&gt;do not have technologies&lt;/a&gt;
capable of economically delivering storage at the scale
needed. Stepping back to examine the how
&lt;a href="https://bravenewclimate.com/2011/10/29/gws-sg-es/#attachment_5198"&gt;vast this scale is&lt;/a&gt;,
it is questionable if sufficient technology will ever exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the standard responses to this is the suggestion of building a
Europe-wide smart-grid. While this may help even out some of the most
extreme troughs in generation, it is still insufficient. There is a
great deal of
&lt;a href="http://euanmearns.com/wind-blowing-nowhere/"&gt;correlation between wind-speeds&lt;/a&gt;
across the continent, so that at times when the wind isn’t blowing
much in Italy, it also won’t be blowing much in Denmark, Germany, the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, or anywhere else on the continent. The net result is that for wind
energy to be a major component of the electricity supply, massive
amounts of more reliable generating capacity
&lt;a href="https://bravenewclimate.com/2011/10/29/gws-sg-es/"&gt;are also needed&lt;/a&gt;. The
eye-catching headline about Germany generating the majority of its
electricity from renewables on some day in July miss the point that it
fails to generate this much on most other days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these problems, how have even existing levels of intermittent
renewable energy proven economical? What about all the people and
companies we hear about running completely off of renewable energy?
While it is, strictly speaking, true that such customers are paying
for all energy they consume to be produced by renewable sources, that
is not to say that the electricity they use &lt;em&gt;at a given time&lt;/em&gt; was from
a renewable source. There would be times when they’re consuming
electricity generated from nuclear power or fossil fuels. It’s just
that at other times, the company they’re buying energy from is
producing more electricity than needed, which is then sold to other
consumers, reducing the need for fossil fuel power plants at that
time. This is all well and good for a consumer who wants to feel smug
about their purchasing decisions, but isn’t of much use if the goal is
powering an entire country (let alone the world) with renewables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, despite the starry-eyed praise often heard for Germany’s
“democratic” energy system, the truth is less than pretty. It is true
that a number of municipalities have bought back their energy grids
and that there are a number of energy co-ops. However, the vast
majority of the renewable capacity is owned by
&lt;a href="http://www.energiewende2015.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Factsheet-Renewables-from-Germany.pdf"&gt;private companies and individuals&lt;/a&gt;.
The feed-in tariffs used to incentivise investment in renewable energy
are set well above market energy prices and have led to the
&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25200808"&gt;highest&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Electricity_prices_for_household_consumers,_second_half_2015_(¹)_(EUR_per_kWh)_YB16.png"&gt;second highest&lt;/a&gt;
energy prices in Europe, while enriching investors and those well-off
enough to own a home on which to install solar panels. And yet, Jeremy
Corbyn
&lt;a href="http://www.solarpowerportal.co.uk/news/labour_leader_labels_fit_cuts_nonsensical_in_renewables_research_pledge"&gt;slammed the Conservatives for cutting feed-in tariffs&lt;/a&gt;.
Worse, the actual reductions in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GHG&lt;/span&gt; emissions is
underwhelming. Assuming that Germany meets its targets
(&lt;a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-set-miss-climate-goals-think-tank/energiewende-what-do-new-laws-mean"&gt;which is dubious&lt;/a&gt;),
it plans for
&lt;a href="https://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Redaktion/PDF/V/vierter-monitoring-bericht-energie-der-zukunft-englische-kurzfassung,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi2012,sprache=de,rwb=true.pdf"&gt;80% of electricity&lt;/a&gt;
to be renewable by 2050. On the other hand, France was able to move a
similar proportion of its electricity production to low-carbon sources
&lt;a href="http://www.iea.org/stats/WebGraphs/FRANCE2.pdf"&gt;in a decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most damming of all, there simply
&lt;a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c18/page_103.shtml"&gt;are not enough&lt;/a&gt;
renewable energy sources in Britain to meet our needs. To come close
would require using every available technology (many of which are
unproven or expensive) and massive amounts of land. There would be
essentially no remaining wilderness and generating capacity would need
to intrude massively upon living areas. More realistic estimates
suggest that renewables can provide just a fraction of
Britain’s power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this makes renewables insufficient if our goal is to
decarbonise our energy production. The problem becomes even worse when
considering that currently
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-consumption-in-the-uk"&gt;electricity makes up only 20%&lt;/a&gt;
of Britain’s energy usage. Even with efficiency gains, electricity
production will have to grow massively if it is to heat homes, fuel
cars, and power trains, and it does not appear that renewables are up
for the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the appeal of renewable energy seems to come from a “small is
beautiful” approach to electricity production. Many people find the idea
of having a distributed energy system made up of individuals, small
businesses, and co-operatives to be appealing. It only goes to show how
much neoliberalism has altered the left’s thinking, that this is
considered a progressive approach. A market of many small producers has
more in common with Adam Smith than with any strain of socialist
thought. Such a policy would be insufficient to fight climate change,
not be able to provide a reliable electricity supply, and enrich a few
well-to-do owners of solar panels and wind farms at the cost of higher
electricity prices for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Energy"></category><category term="British Politics"></category><category term="Renewables"></category><category term="Climate Change"></category></entry><entry><title>No Limits on the Left</title><link href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/no-limits-on-the-left.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-27T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-09-27T01:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>C.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s something you won’t hear everyday: I’m to the left of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn"&gt;Jeremy Corbyn&lt;/a&gt;. If you
listened to much of the British media, you wouldn’t think that’s
possible, given that the now twice-elected leader of the Labour Party
is apparently a Lenin-loving, Hamas-hugging, business-bashing commie
fiend dead-set on nationalising your children and making them go on
strike in reopened coal mines. And yet, here I am, proudly nailing my
colours to the mast, revealing them to being considerably redder than
those of certain bearded Bolshevik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, anyone who is actually paying attention to what
Corbyn has been saying and is being intellectually honest will have to
admit that his politics aren’t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; radical. He’s promised
significant public investment, a move away from fossil fuels, faster
Internet connections, stronger collective bargaining, and a number of
other extremely welcome measures which nonetheless would keep Britain
a firmly capitalism society. The only industry which he’s promised to
nationalise is rail, which is so obviously sensible that even a
majority of Tory voters support it, and possibly portions of the bus
network. This barely scratches the surface of the nationalisations
overseen by
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_Attlee"&gt;Clem Attlee’s&lt;/a&gt; postwar
Labour government, let alone the sorts of proposals put forward by
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Benn"&gt;Tony Benn&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt;
leader of the Labour Left) in the 1970s and ‘80s. This is not to say
that I don’t think that, at heart, Corbyn is considerably more radical
than his policies suggest, but his actual platform is some way to the
right of what I’d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m not writing this simply to moan about Corbyn being too
moderate or betraying his roots or anything like that. I get that he
is in a difficult position where he has to put forward policy which
can win elections, hold the Labour Party together, and successfully be
implemented without insurmountable resistance from the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister"&gt;civil service&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Very_British_Coup#Differences_between_novel_and_TV"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt;. At
some point compromises are going to be made and some of those are not
going to be ones which I’ll find acceptable. A case in point is the
recent move of some of those around the leadership to
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/26/jeremy-corbyn-puts-aside-objections-to-renewing-trident"&gt;get behind the renewal&lt;/a&gt;
of the Trident nuclear weapons&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I get that this may be seen as a
necessary compromise if they are to pursue their agenda of
democratising the economy. At the same time, though, I &lt;strong&gt;can not in
any way support&lt;/strong&gt; any policy which would see tens, if not hundreds, of
billions of pounds spent on weapons of mass destruction. It would be
bad enough keeping the weapons if they were already built and just
sitting there, but it is utterly unconscionable to actually be
spending the money to build them yourself. Yes, the renewal will
likely be underway by the time Labour could hypothetically be elected,
but it will not be finished, will still be costing money, and could
still be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems we now face is that the Labour Party now has no
left wing. Most people would look at me very strangely indeed for
saying that, given that one of its most left wing MPs is now the
leader.  What I mean is that there is now no one to the left of the
leader who can hold him to account and act as the party’s
conscience. Having an uncompromising left block in parliament is
important because it is able to act as a counterweight on the
leadership when it is under pressure from business, the civil service,
or the international community to abandon its goals. This is similar
to the problem experienced in places like Bolivia and
&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/panitch-greece-baltas-syriza-leadership-tsipras/"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;
where the most capable left-wing organisers ended up being drawn into
the state, with little capacity for independent organising left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally this could be a role played by the membership, or at least a
subset of it. However, most of the new members are left-progressive
types rather than hard-core socialists (let-alone the
&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/08/watson-corbyn-red-scare-militant-trotskyists/"&gt;Trotskyists&lt;/a&gt;
that the media would have us believe no run the party). These are
people who would have voted
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales"&gt;Green&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_Cymru"&gt;Plaid Cymru&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or even
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats"&gt;Lib-Dem&lt;/a&gt; in previous
elections and are not familiar with the detailed socialist
analysis&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I don’t mean to be condescending to these people, as
socialists must be able to reach out to them and convince them, but my
point is that quite a bit of work is required before much of the
membership is likely to be able to act as a significant counterweight
to right-wing pressure on the leadership. The fact that much of the
politics of these new members seems to be based around supporting
Corbyn will also make it more difficult for them to apply pressure on
him when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the left-wing currents within labour are not helping with
this. While they could be staking out a space to develop the left
policy they want, without having to worry so much about not
antagonising the Labour Right, instead their approach seems to be to
provide uncritical support to the leadership and its policies. The
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/JeremyCorbyn4PM/"&gt;Jeremy Corbyn for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Facebook page seems to consist mainly of praising whatever the
leadership says, while &lt;a href="http://www.peoplesmomentum.com/"&gt;Momentum&lt;/a&gt; has
been little more than a Jeremy Corbyn fan club. Both display a
slightly revolting level of sycophancy and hero-worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This must not continue. We on the left must not be afraid to publicly
disagree with the leadership if they are doing something which we
consider to be wrong. Motions should be put forward to conference
calling for more radical actions than Corbyn has been willing to
discuss so far. I’m not saying that we should just propose whatever we
want, regardless of its practicality or ability to get traction with
the electorate. There’s no point trying to get a demand for collective
ownership of the means of production and distribution into the next
Labour manifesto&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or to propose budgets using misleading
figures. We still need to consider what is achievable, but if our
opinion on this differs from that of the leadership (as mine does in
many cases) then we should not be afraid to say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Corbyn’s positions should not represent the limit of left wing policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NATO&lt;/span&gt; a collectivist, internationalist organisation during this speech also really took the cake. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I am stating this as a fact, not meaning to
place any particular mourning or celebration in it. I can’t say I’m a fan of
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. I think it is neoliberal and unaccountable, probably
irredeemably so in both cases. But I take no joy in the outcome of
this vote. The narrative leading to Brexit was not one of building a
better future based on cooperation, without the constant calls for
greater “competitiveness”. Instead, it was a narrative of
out-of-control immigration, the interfering outsiders, Britain no
longer being Great thanks to the burdens of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. It was not a
pleasant campaign for those of us on the Left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear: I am a believer in democratic
European federalism. However, I have serious doubts that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; can
ever become such a system, given its extreme democratic deficit. At
best, I think that a set of countries, which would like need to be
lead by Leftist governments, would essentially secede from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; at
once to form some other institution.  More likely,
any such government would be forced out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; if it tried to
implement a serious Leftist program, long before a coordinated
secession could be achieved. I don’t think the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; will ever be
a conducive battleground for Leftist ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this leaves us in a depressing state. The exit vote was driven by
right-wing narratives, while staying would have locked us into a neoliberal
framework. I knew this was the choice ahead of us long before the vote
occurred. We were faced only with bad outcomes. Given that, I
won’t condemn anyone on the Left for their choices, whether they voted
to leave, remain, spoiled their ballot, or abstained. I knew that,
however they voted, Leftists were not motivated by racism or
nationalism but by a genuine concern for building a better world. I knew that,
regardless of the result of the vote, we were going to need to fight
harder than ever to build international solidarity, to develop
coherent policies for a socialist program, to bring the hundreds of
thousands, if not millions, of dispossessed Britons and Europeans into
the struggle for a better future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the vote was for Brexit. We have to accept that. We don’t have
to like it or agree with it, but we have to accept it. Calling the
people who voted for it stupid, or racists, or saying that you’re
ashamed to be British isn’t going to do any good. In fact, it will
only alienate the Brexit voters—who we’ll need if the Left is ever to
get elected—even more. Today may well have been a defeat for
the Left, but the Left has had almost nothing but defeats in this
country (or anywhere else) since 1979. We know how to keep on
going. Raging against the outcome won’t help us do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brexit vote happened. We don’t yet know what the final resolution to
this story will be, but we have to do everything in our power to ensure
that our future outside of the European Union is as just and humane as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: My reaction to the vote on leaving the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; was confusing and
complex. This was an attempt to put it into words. I’m not entirely
satisfied with what I’ve written; I feel like I could have been more
eloquent and have perhaps missed a few points. Nonetheless, I’ve
managed to clarify and codify at least some of my thoughts on this
confusing issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="UK"></category><category term="EU"></category><category term="British Politics"></category><category term="Europe"></category><category term="Brexit"></category></entry><entry><title>Greeks Bearing Debts</title><link href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/greeks-bearing-debts.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-23T01:30:00+01:00</published><updated>2015-06-23T01:30:00+01:00</updated><author><name>C.

Just over five months ago, Greece elected a new government lead by left-wing
party &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; comes out of a radical tradition rejecting both
reformist social democracy and authoritarian communism and was swept to power
on a wave of anti-austerity sentiment. Austerity refers to the massive cuts to
public spending (tending to hurt particularly those on lower incomes) which
Greece has endured over the past five years, along with
the associated policies of deregulation, cuts to the minimum wage, an end to
collective bargaining, and the privatization of anything which actually makes
a profit for the government. These policies have been devastating for Greece,
resulting in a 26% contraction in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;, ~25% unemployment, over 50% youth
unemployment, and a humanitarian disaster as people can’t get access to food,
energy, shelter, or basic healthcare.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it is fair to say that Greece did borrow too much money over the years
leading up to the crisis. However, I think it is also fair to say that there
is an inverse relationship between someone’s culpability for the debt and the
pain which they have experienced under austerity. It is also true that the
Greek state is hopelessly corrupt. That said, of all of the parties represented
in the Hellenic Parliament, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; is probably the one with the greatest
commitment to try to tack that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, none of this is new—it was all equally the case when &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; was elected
in January. At that time, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; had pledged to end austerity while staying a
part of the Eurozone and refraining from any unilateral actions (i.e. defaulting
on the debt). Given that Greeks overwhelmingly favour staying in the Euro, it
is not surprising that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; would make such a commitment. They insisted that
they would be able to reverse austerity by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediately implementing the
&lt;a href="http://www.syriza.gr/article/SYRIZA---THE-THESSALONIKI-PROGRAMME.html#.VYjAUnMl_VM"&gt;Thessaloniki Program&lt;/a&gt;
which purported to provide a mild Keynseianism with the resources already
available to the Greek government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renegotiating the debt with Europe, on the basis that austerity clearly was
not leading to growth and was hurting the Eurozone as a whole. Furthermore, they
would point out that there was no way that Greece would ever be able to repay
the debt as the situations currently stands, whether they want to or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it almost immediately&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; became clear to anyone who was watching with
a remotely level head that this would not be as easy as was claimed. The
leadership of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; are die-hard Europeans who, reportedly, believe in the
European project (European integration which, in reality, means the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; and the
Euro) at a deep emotional level. They were thus extremely reluctant to
countenance any sort of break with Europe, even without considering that public
opinion took a similar view. It would thus appear that they genuinely thought
that, if they were to sit down and explain to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; why austerity was
wrong-headed then it would see the light. Now, I certainly would not condemn
giving this a try—after all, what have they got to loose? But I found it
incredibly hard to believe that they would go into these quixotic negotiations
without even a sketch of an alternative plan to pursue if they failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet that is what seems to be the case. In February, prompted by the
potential collapse of the Greek banking sector, Athens signed a deal with the
European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary
Fund (previously called “the Troika,” since renamed “the institutions” or “the
Brussels group” for reasons of political spin) in order to ensure that the
European Central Bank would keep it afloat. However, this deal represented
a &lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/02/syriza-euro-austerity-troika/"&gt;major retreat&lt;/a&gt;
from their election promises, as it committed them to austerity (with vague
enough language that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; naively hoped that they could wriggle out of it)
and forbade them from passing any legislation which could, in the view of
“the institutions,” endanger the Greek “recovery.” The worst part of all of this
was that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; leadership tried to portray this as a victory and proof that
it was possible to negotiate a resolution with Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, since that time, Greece has not actually seen any of the money that
they were promised from the Troika, as they must first start to implement the
structural adjustments demanded. This has left Athens with very little money
to make repayments on various loans coming due and, over the past few month,
the government has been drained of any remaining cash. With a major repayment
due to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMF&lt;/span&gt; at the end of June, things were getting desperate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to get access to the funds that they had been promised, the Greek
government began backsliding on ever more of their promises. A call to halt
(and even reverse) privatizations gave way to pursuing “partnerships” with the
private sector to develop state assets, to partial privatization, to
privatization full-stop. Commitments to restore pensions to their previous
levels became a promise not to decrease them further. Promises to reduce sales
tax have turned into pledges not to raise it on essential items. A goal of
running balanced budgets (rather than a surplus) became a request to simply run
a smaller surplus. And any talk of a comprehensive investment plan to spur
growth has vanished. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt;’s insistence that there were certain red lines which
they would not cross looked ever more dubious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, at the eleventh hour, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; has
&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/22/greece-deal-red-lines-blur-and-bend"&gt;given way&lt;/a&gt;
on their pledges to protect pensions and not to raise sales tax. They’ve even
succumbed to calls for a higher budget surplus. To be honest, I’m somewhat
surprised by this; I had expected that if they were going to give in on those
issues then they would have done it before now. All I can conclude is that the
leadership really didn’t know what it was doing and had persisted in the blind
belief that Europe was bluffing and would give in if they waited long enough.
But to anyone with half a brain it should have been obvious that this was a
delusion, at least after the agreement in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt;’s Left Platform, this has long been the case. Prominent members have
&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/greece-syriza-eurogroup-negotiations-austerity/"&gt;consistently&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/04/syriza-eurozone-default-exit-stathis/"&gt;been calling&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/05/kouvelakis-syriza-ecb-grexit/"&gt;for a&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/05/greece-syriza-european-union-austerity-troika/"&gt;break with&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/06/kouvelakis-greece-europe-negotiations-debt-default/"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;
since February. Economist and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP&lt;/span&gt; Costas Lapavitsas has been
&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/lapavitsas-varoufakis-grexit-syriza/"&gt;urging an exit&lt;/a&gt;
from the Eurozone since before the election and has
&lt;a href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/1949-against-the-troika"&gt;drawn up plans&lt;/a&gt;
for how this could be accomplished. A growing number of people on the left
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt;’s mainstream faction have also been won over to this view after having
witnessed the ever greater concessions which have been offered in order to
avoid rupture with Europe. However, none of this has affected the official
discourse of the party and, as such, the Greek public has been fed the delusion
that relief from austerity is possible within the Euro and support for some sort
of compromise—which, seeing as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; has given way on virtually all of its
initial bargaining positions while the institutions have given way on hardly any, is
impossible. The end result: Greeks remain totally unprepared for any sort of
rupture with Europe, having been scared stiff by the media and pandering
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; politicians of the consequences of doing anything which might endanger
their place in the Euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what now? Well, there are
&lt;a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2015/06/deal-with-greece-still-looks-wobbly.html"&gt;still questions&lt;/a&gt;
over whether a deal will actually be reached. But if it is, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt;’s leaders
will still need to sell it to the rest of the party. And it is
&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/23/greek-crisis-bailout-deal-eurozone-crucial-optimism-rises"&gt;not at all clear&lt;/a&gt; that this will happen. While it
may get the support of a majority of the cabinet, there is every sign that
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt;’s coalition partner will reject it (especially if it involves hikes
to sales tax) and I suspect that at least 20% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt;’s own MPs would vote
against it. This would be enough to make &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; rely on the support of
opposition parties to pass such a bill, which would be humiliating and would
damage the party’s image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it remains a distinct possibility that the party’s central
committee will vote down accepting any such deal. A few weeks ago there was
a vote on a motion to break with Europe, which lost 75-95. That means only 11
committee members would have to swing in order for such a proposal to win now.
Given the scope of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt;’s retreat, such a result would seem entirely
possible. Then there is the prospect of discontent in the party grassroots.
Already the youth wing has held protests indicating that they would prefer
&lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6a111b26-1583-11e5-8e6a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3dvfKopVr"&gt;“chaos to capitulation”&lt;/a&gt;.
So a split in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; ranks is looking increasingly likeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the point which caused me to write this article: how should the
international Left respond to these developments? For months socialist across
Europe have been expressing solidarity with Greeks and the Greek government,
while upstart parties have been advertising themselves as the
&lt;a href="http://podemos.info/"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://leftunity.org/"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://hdpenglish.wordpress.com/"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt;. Should they continue to offer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; their
unconditional support? Should they condemn this retreat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a tricky question, made all the harder by these groups’ uncritical approach
to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; over the past while. Billing yourself as a party in the image of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; will be distinctly damaging if &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; is forced to retreat. I think it’s
fair to say that we on the Left must continue to offer the Greek people our
solidarity. However, no such solidarity should be extended to any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; member
who is willing to implement austerity. Fair enough, they are in an incredibly
difficult situation and it is all too easy for us to criticize when we can’t
even imagine being able to form a government in our home countries. But the fact
remains, if we are to be at all consistent then we must not endorse anyone who
implements austerity, whether they come from a left-wing background or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Free Greece from the European Prison" class="img-center" src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/greeceEuropeCage.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what should &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; do? From the comfort of my armchair in a country which
has not been ravaged by austerity and is safely on its own currency and who
won’t be hurt if things go wrong, here are
my thoughts. For starters, they should get rid of their
leader, Alexis Tsipras, finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, and the inner circle
which surrounds them. This group has clearly revealed
themselves to be incapable of pushing back austerity in Greece, let alone of
laying the ground for overcoming capitalism. At the very least, Varoufakis
should be forced to resign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next comes the problem that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; does not have a mandate for breaking with
Europe. As I said earlier, they were elected promising to end austerity while
remaining in the Eurozone. However, nor do they have any mandate to implement
austerity as they look prepared to do. I’m not totally adverse to the concept
of pushing ahead and breaking with austerity, leaving the Euro if necessary,
mandate be damned. To be sure, such an approach has risks, but I can’t help but
feel that those risks are better than the certainty of austerity-induced
misery within the Euro. 
In all probability, this will require a fresh election or a referendum in order
to justify it to the electorate. What’s
more, there is a very good chance that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; would lose such an election and
it would almost certainly lose such a referendum. Well, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Greek people decide that they would prefer austerity over leaving the
Euro, then &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; should resign. Let a party which really believes in austerity
be the one to implement it. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; would be better off in opposition, agitating
for an end to austerity even if it does mean a break with Europe. This would be
a serious setback but, unlike giving in to austerity, not a fatal one.
Let &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; live to fight another day.&lt;/p&gt;

MacMackin</name></author><id>tag:politicalphysicist.github.io,2015-01-28:lets-talk-about-bell.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s that time of year again. The good people at Bell, through their
Let’s Talk campaign, are once again
donating money to mental health initiatives. All they ask in return is that
we spread the word by sharing their posts about it on Facebook. Isn’t that
nice of them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="The Let's Talk ad" src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/bell-lets-talk.jpg"/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Let’s Talk ad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no, it’s not, on several levels. First and foremost, if they really care
about mental health then surely they can just donate the money anyway, rather
than only do so if people share their Facebook posts. Which let’s us know that
mental health is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what they really care about here. As, I suspect, with
most corporate donations, the real motivation is how it will effect their image.
Donating to charity will make them appear to be generous and good corporate
citizens, at least to those who are less cynical than me. Presumably they feel
that this will make people slightly more likely to choose them over Rogers (or
whatever other company you decide on from the myriad of—pardon me, virtually
&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;—other choices that exist in Canada).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here Bell are exceptionally clever. In addition to the usual posturing you
get when a company donates to a good cause, this campaign is all about providing
Bell with advertising. It’s built into the model, as the more people who share
Bell’s post, the more money they will donate.
They say that for every time their post
is shared they will donate 5 cents to mental health initiatives. According to
one website, it costs about 25 cents to reach 1000 people on Facebook. That
means that each person sharing the Bell post would only need 201 friends in
order for this to be cheaper.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is far cheaper than advertising in
conventional media, or even most other online media. Furthermore, these shared
Bell posts will not be susceptible to adblocking software, as normal Facebook
advertising is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we’ve established that Bell is not doing this out of the kindness of their
heart, but because of the positive impact on their brand and the advertising
which it generates. But surely we can still be happy about the positive outcome,
regardless of the motives behind it? Well, in a sense I suppose we should, as
this money is certainly better spent on mental health initiatives than on
returns to shareholders. But then again, we shouldn’t. If Bell feels that it
has this money to give away, then to me that indicates that they aren’t being
taxed enough. If they were then the revenue could be used by the government to
provide mental health initiative directly. Moreover, it would be under our
democratic control to decide if this is, indeed, the best way to spend it.
Maybe we’d decide that there is some other health concern which would be a
better use of the money. As it stand now, we have no choice in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might ask why we should have a choice. After all, it’s Bell’s money. But
where does Bell get it’s money from? Consumers, of course. So it’s all of our
money really. That means that we should have a say over how it’s spent.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Furthermore, as a way of collecting money to provide services, this is highly
regressive. Why should the amount that we spend on telecom determine how much
we contribute towards mental health initiatives? Shouldn’t those who have more
money be contributing a greater percentage of their income? This is the
approach we take to taxation, after all. This argument, of course,
applies to all corporate charity. Given this, surely the best way to fund things
like mental health initiatives is via taxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Bell, if you want to help contribute that money to good causes, why don’t
you give it to the government? They can spend it as necessary. Better yet, you
could let yourself be voluntarily nationalized, so that telecom could be
provided at cost, or even for free. Let this essential service, like those
surrounding mental health, be funded progressively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fairness, that is probably rather optimistic, as there is plenty of overlap between people’s groups of friends. Nonetheless, it’s pretty good value. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel tempted to argue that this logic applies to any way in which a company spends its money, then I agree. That is why I’m a socialist and believe in public ownership. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Several weeks ago, now, I read a news story on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBC&lt;/span&gt; about the
&lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/drug-shortages-worsening-as-health-canada-starts-study-to-address-it-1.2652581"&gt;problem of drug shortages&lt;/a&gt;.
It appears that it is not uncommon for pharmaceutical companies (I’m going to
avoid the term “Big Pharma” here, as to me it always sound like a juvenile
attempt at fear-mongering) to suddenly stop, or at least drastically scale down,
production of frequently used drugs. Unfortunately, no real solutions were
being offered to this. At most, Health Canada was trying to make it mandatory
for the manufacturers to report shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by no means the only problem that exists with pharmaceutical companies.
I vaguely remember hearing several years ago on an American news channel that
many companies were no longer producing generics, as they are not very
profitable. Of course, generics are a lot cheaper for consumers, as they are
not subject to the legal monopoly of patent law. Patents themselves are
problematic as they increase prices, but some form of patent protection seems
to be needed in order to encourage innovation and the development of new
drugs by the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even patents aren’t always enough to encourage the research we need. This
became clear in a recent report by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBC&lt;/span&gt; that pharmaceutical companies
&lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/antibiotic-scientist-must-push-discovery-to-market-1.2686347?cmp=rss"&gt;do not seem to be interested in developing new antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;.
The reason for this is that this is quite a research-intensive process with
relatively low returns, as antibiotics aren’t used that much compared to
medication for chronic conditions. However, it is absolutely vital that new
antibiotics are developed as old ones are becoming ineffective against
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is becoming so acute that even
&lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, a liberal but hardly a socialist
publication, published an editorial calling for all pharmaceutical companies
to be converted non-profit bodies charged with pursuing the public interest.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Whether this meant nationalization or simply conversion to independent
non-profit organizations (or some mixture of the two) I am not sure.
In any case,
I strongly support such a demand and think that it would be enormously
beneficial. Those who know me well won’t be surprised by this, as it seems that
my response to just about any problem that I see in the economy is to
nationalize the relevant sector.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in this case I am perfectly willing to call for a more pragmatic
solution—at least for the time being. Given how important a steady supply of
drugs is to the healthcare system, you don’t want to do anything that could
seriously disrupt their production. Also, this is a problem which really does
need to be fixed as soon as possible and, while the nationalization of a whole
sector would never win broad support in the near future,&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; a more
moderate idea might. Not to say that this idea isn’t radical given the current
political climate, but it is something which could be justified based on
pragmatism and could still seem at least vaguely conceivable to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My proposal is fairly simple: the creation of a new Crown Corporation.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Since
most people my age won’t know what this is (it having been so
long since any new ones have been created) I’ll explain: a Crown Corporation is
a companies which, rather than being owned by private individuals or listed
on the stock market, is owned by the government. The only significant example
in Nova Scotia is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSLC&lt;/span&gt; (the liquor stores). In most of Canada (although not Nova
Scotia) the power companies are owned by the provincial government.
Federal Crown Corporations include Canada Post, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBC&lt;/span&gt;, and Via Rail.
We used to own a lot more too: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NS&lt;/span&gt; Power, Air Canada, the Uranium mines,
Canadian National Railway, and  Petro-Canada, among others. However,
these were sold
off in the ‘80s and ‘90s, purportedly to improve the efficiency of these
companies although I’m inclined to think that it was primarily for ideological reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to my point. I think that the government should create a new Crown
Corporation which, for the sake of argument, I shall call Pharmacy Canada.
Pharmacy Canada would be charged with the development of new drugs which would
tend to have a low rate of return on investment (such as antibiotics) as well
as producing generic drugs. These would be sold at cost to the provincial health
authorities. They could also be sold slightly above cost to other developed
countries and, perhaps, at a subsidized rate to developing countries. An
additional role that could be played by Pharmacy Canada would be to act as a
bulk-purchaser of those drugs which still needed to be obtained from the
private sector. These would then be sold on, at cost, to the provinces as well.
The advantage of such centralized purchasing that it would place
Pharmacy Canada in a position to negotiate lower prices. This is a system
which has been used successfully by charities to deliver cheaper drugs to
developing countries and is, in fact, called for by the Green Party (although
no doubt they would balk at the idea of actually &lt;em&gt;producing&lt;/em&gt; drugs in the public
sector). All of these policies would help to reduce the price of drugs,
stabilizing the
fastest growing component of healthcare costs and making our public healthcare
system more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all eminently achievable even within the current political situation.
While it would, no doubt, be heavily lobbied against by the pharmaceutical
companies, I don’t see what they could actually do to prevent it. I suppose they
could retaliate through capital flight, although I don’t see how this would be
in their interest. If they were to try then their old factories could be bought
up by Pharmacy Canada, thus protecting jobs. While setting up a new Crown
Corporation would require some capital, interest rates remain low and the
federal government has a high credit rating, allowing it to borrow cheaply.
The federal deficit is almost gone and we could be running a substantial
surplus if we were to return taxes to their 2000 levels. Thus I don’t think that
there is any real financial argument against establishing Pharmacy Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary objection to this would be ideological: the belief that the
government is not capable of running a successful, productive, company. Such
attitudes are wide-spread, even among liberals and social democrats (e.g. the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDP&lt;/span&gt;). While there have been some issues with Crown Corporations in the past, I
still think that they were much better run than people give them credit for.
They may not have had the profit margins of private enterprise, but this is
because they were meant to be meeting social, not just purely economic
objectives. Objecting to this (as is done by my father) is to miss the entire
purpose of a Crown Corporation; if you wanted it to be run just like a private
company then you’d have left it in the private sector in the first place.
Although Pharmacy Canada wouldn’t deliver the same profit margins as the
existing private pharmaceutical companies, it would be able to perform
functions which they are
failing to do. This sort of value can not be reflected in simple calculations
of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I suspect that the traditional means of running Crown Corporations&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; would be able to achieve much of what I describe, I believe that
even greater accomplishments could be made if Pharmacy Canada were to be run
along socialist lines. This would mean that the board would consist of
representatives of researchers, doctors, employees, patients, and government.
The advantages to this are twofold. First,
and more abstractly, it would ensure that the company was run democratically,
something which I think has value in its own right. But second, the
representation of researchers and doctors would ensure that fruitful avenues of
research were being pursued. My strong suspicion is that this would prove a
mores successful (as measured in health outcomes, rather than profit) way of
directing research than what is currently provided by the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, being the realist/cynic that I am, I realize that the creation of Pharmacy
Canada stands absolutely no chance of happening even if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDP&lt;/span&gt; were elected
in 2015. The idea of public enterprise has simply crept too far outside of the
political mainstream. But this is no reason to stop talking about it; if it is
ever to get back into the political mainstream then it is something which must
become broadly popular and also seriously discussed in progressive political
circles. We need organizations like &lt;a href="https://www.broadbentinstitute.ca/en"&gt;The Broadbent Institute&lt;/a&gt;,
the &lt;a href="http://www.canadians.org/"&gt;Council of Canadians&lt;/a&gt;, and the
&lt;a href="https://www.policyalternatives.ca/"&gt;Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives&lt;/a&gt;
not only to call for such a policy but to perform studies detailing how to do
it. Nor should we be afraid to suggest it as individuals. Because, at least in
this case, the radical is becoming the pragmatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do realize that this alone won’t fix all of the problems, as democratic control is needed over public enterprise if it is to truly behave differently than private enterprise (other than just behaving slightly more bureaucratically). Nonetheless, nationalization is usually a good start in my view, as it begins to address the questions of ownership, control, and power. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few countries, there are a few sectors which may prove an exception to this. For example, the rail and energy sectors in Britain or the financial sector in Greece. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are unaware, in Canada “the Crown” tends to refer to “the state”. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

you), there are currently elections going on for the European Parliament. This
is, in principle, the legislative body of the European Union, although in
practice it is debatable how much power it actually holds. For this reason,
European elections don’t usually attract too much attention, even in Europe,
and tend to have turnouts similar to those in municipal elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Alex Tsipras campaigning for the Party of the European Left." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/euroLeft.jpg"/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Alex Tsipras campaigning for the Party of the European Left.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as an international observer, what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; quite interesting about
the European Parliament (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt;) is the shear diversity of parties represented in
it. Compared to the recent Nova Scotian election, where there was so much
homogeneity that you would be
hard-pressed to tell which party anyone belonged to, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt; elections overwhelm
you with choice. But, before I go into what the various choices are, I’ll just
provide a bit of background on how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt; works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every country is given a certain number of seats in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt;, distributed
according to population.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Exactly how Members of the European Parliament
(MEPs) are elected is left up to the individual countries, the only
requirement being that some form of
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt;
is used. In each country, the various national parties will put forward
candidates, some of whom will be elected. Most of the national parties will
also hold an affiliation to a European party. Elected MEPs sit in groups with
their national party, which in turn sits in a group with similar parties from
other countries, roughly along the lines of the various European parties.
Because these groups consist of a collection of national parties, they won’t
necessarily have a single, coherent position—a national party will often vote
differently from its group. Additionally, the Europarties play little roll
outside of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt;; national parties campaign individually on their own set
of policies. Of
course, this all seems unnecessarily complicated and confusing, but there you
are. As best as I can tell, the reason for this complexity is that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;
never really arose out of a plan but was more stitched together bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The groups within the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt; are (with the main Europarty composing them given
in parentheses, if more than one):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European People’s Party&lt;/strong&gt;: Pro-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; (support tighter integration),
conservative. Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats are notable members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats&lt;/strong&gt;: Pro-Europe, social
democracy (centre-left). While consisting of the Party of European Socialists,
in reality
they are not that different from the European People’s Party when it comes to economics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group&lt;/strong&gt;: Pro-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;, centrist,
socially liberal, free-market economics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Greens—European Free Alliance&lt;/strong&gt; (European Green Party): Green politics,
and representatives of nations without states (ex: Scotland, Wales, Catalonia).
Economically progressive in principle, but been known to give in to conservatism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European Conservatives and Reformists&lt;/strong&gt; (Movement for European Reform):
Conservative, anti-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. The British Conservatives are part of this party, but not
many other members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European United Left—Nordic Green Left&lt;/strong&gt; (Party of the European Left):
Socialists and communists. Supportive of European integration but don’t like
the current setup of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Europe of Freedom and Democracy&lt;/strong&gt; (Movement for a Europe of Liberties and
Democracy): Anti-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;, highly conservative, right-wing populist. Tend to be very
anti-immigrant and, in particular, anti-Muslim. Similarities to the Tea Party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is given in descending order of the size of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt; groups. What is
interesting about this election, in particular, is that the more radical parties
are expected to do well; the European Left and Europe of Freedom
and Democracy are both hoping to make gains.
The latter has proven especially good at
tapping into discontent and anti-politics sentiment, often presenting themselves
as a real alternative to the now indistinguishable main-stream parties. I
suppose this is, strictly speaking, true as the main-stream parties tend to be
pro-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; and in agreement over centre-right economics. However, it is disingenuous
in the extreme for them to portray themselves as representing ordinary people;
for example, one of the most notable constituent national parties, the United
Kingdom Independence Party (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UKIP&lt;/span&gt;), is led by wealthy financier and
arch-&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage"&gt;Thatcherite&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage"&gt;Nigel Farage&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, since he drinks,
smokes, and is more plain-speaking than leaders of the larger parties, he
somehow comes off as a man of the people. This has, at times, bizarre results.
For example, a
&lt;a href="http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/11/04/nationalise-energy-and-rail-companies-say-public/"&gt;poll showed&lt;/a&gt;
that an overwhelming majority of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UKIP&lt;/span&gt; voters support
renationalization of rail and energy companies. The only party whose voters
supported these policies in higher numbers was Labour (unsurprising, given its
socialist origins). Yet &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UKIP&lt;/span&gt; has a radical “small government” policy, more
extreme even than the Conservatives’.&lt;sup id="fnref:1.5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1.5" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; All in all, it seems
that it is social policy that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UKIP&lt;/span&gt; and  Europe of Freedom and Democracy attract
people with. Sad to say, many working class people with progressive economics
are distinctly xenophobic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far more encouraging is the growth of the European United Left—Nordic Green
Left (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUL&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGL&lt;/span&gt;). The national parties in this group are, to a greater or lesser
degree,
socialists. They are all vehemently opposed to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism"&gt;neoliberalism&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and most are (at least officially) opposed to
capitalism itself. Policies vary from stronger regulation and increased public
spending, to (re)nationalisation of banks and energy companies
(which seems to be
the standard position of group members), to outright revolutionary (although not
necessarily insurrectionary&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) socialism. Additionally, they call for making
the structures of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; much more democratic. As you might have gathered, the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; is a rather ungainly institution. There are three governing bodies, only one
of which (the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt;) is directly elected. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUL&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGL&lt;/span&gt; supports giving more power to the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt; in order to help remedy this. In addition, the European Central Bank (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt;, in
charge of the Euro’s monetary policy) is not under any sort of democratic
control. This, in particular, is something that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUL&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGL&lt;/span&gt; wishes to change, with
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt; appointing the Banks governors and setting its mandate (as is done with
most central banks, including the Bank of Canada). They have good reason for
this, as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt;’s current policies have exacerbated the crises in Italy,
Greece, &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; (“the periphery”). It is resolving these crises that
makes up the centrepiece of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUL&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGL&lt;/span&gt; policies. The intention is to implement an industrial and redistributive
policy which will eliminate the imbalances between “the centre” (Germany,
France, etc.) and the periphery. While these proposals are really social
democratic, rather than anti-capitalist, they would nonetheless be of great
help and would likely make it easier for national governments to implement more radical policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is some debate over how committed to European integration the
Left should be. Some feel that, because neoliberalism has more or less been
written into the very structure of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;, the Left should be Eurosceptical.
However, as described above, the general position is that the Left should
reform the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. There appear to be two main reasons to pursue this policy. One
is an objection to nationalism, which caused so much carnage in the first half
of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. It was to prevent something like this from ever
happening again that European integration was originally begun. The second
reason is that it is felt you would need to be coming to power on a continental
scale if you seriously want to confront, let alone do away with, capitalism.
Otherwise any country attempting the transition to socialism would end up
isolated as capitalist nations began committing economic warfare (as happened
to Chile in the late ‘60s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of the above arguments are strong. However, the issues arises of what will
happen if a Left government comes to power in one country much sooner than the
others. This is not just idle speculation, as there is a very good chance that
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUL&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGL&lt;/span&gt; member &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriza"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will come to
power in Greece in their next election.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; has campaigned around ending
the austerity in Greece, which is causing massive damage to their economy and
creating a humanitarian crisis. However, doing so would involve renegotiating
bailout terms with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. But, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; is also determined to stay in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;
and to keep Greece on the Euro. It is unclear that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; would allow them to
do both of these things. Undoubtedly, it would be difficult for Greece to leave
the Euro and it would also be extremely unpopular for them to pull out of the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. From my knowledge, it appears that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; will only go as far as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;
lets them. Hopefully, this will be far enough to resolve the Greek crisis
(kicking out Greece would likely be damaging to Europe as well), but that might
not be the case. For what it’s worth, my personal view is that Greece
shouldn’t pull out on its own but if, in the course of implementing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt;’s
policies, they get kicked out then so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting case study (if only because all of the debates here are in
English) is the formation of the new &lt;a href="http://leftunity.org/"&gt;Left Unity&lt;/a&gt; party
in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. This party is actually fairly radical compared to some of its
Continental counterparts, calling for a much greater degree of nationalization
(although I suppose that Britain has a history of more extensive public
ownership than most countries, so perhaps that isn’t surprising). The issue here
is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; regulations would make it vary difficult for Left Unity to implement
many of its policies if elected. However, the reasons for staying in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;
that I mentioned above are just as true for Britain as anywhere else and, as
a result, Left Unity has much the same set of policies regarding the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. In this
case, I think the answer is much more clean-cut. The radical left in
Britain is lagging far behind the rest of Europe,&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so it is unlikely that
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; would have a Left government before the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; as a whole. Therefore, they
might as well advocate staying in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; and take the same position as the rest of the
European Left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I think that, with the possible exception of countries like Greece, the
Left should be trying the achieve socialism at the European level. Various
think-tanks, such the &lt;a href="http://www.rosalux.de/english/foundation.html"&gt;Rosa-Luxemburg Siftung&lt;/a&gt; (associated with the German party &lt;a href="http://en.die-linke.de/die-linke/welcome/"&gt;Die Linke&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://transform-network.net/home.html"&gt;transform!&lt;/a&gt;
(loosely associated with the &lt;a href="http://www.european-left.org/"&gt;Party of the European Left&lt;/a&gt;) have called for the ultimate establishment of the United Socialist
States of Europe. This, I think, is an admirable goal. However, I am not
convinced that this goal can be achieved with the current European leftist
institutions. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UEL&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGL&lt;/span&gt; and the Party of the European Left are both much too
loose as associations. To the extent that they coordinate trans-European
campaigns
at all, they tend to be centred around policies making up the least radical
common denominator of their members. For the most part, as with all of the
Europarties, active campaigning is left to the individual national members.
However, as is generally acknowledged, building socialism requires a Europe-wide
movement. That means a truly Europe-wide party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I feel, to be successful, the members of the Party of the European
Left will have to give up their individual identities. They’ll have to become
national chapters of a continent-wide party. And, do you know what? I’m actually
somewhat hopeful. For all the mess that the world is in and all the ways that
mess is likely to get worse, I can’t help but feel that we’ll pull through it.
It won’t be easy, but the worthwhile things seldom are. To the extent that I
have faith in anything, I have faith that humanity is capable of being better
than it is today. I think Europe can do it—it can overcome the more
unpleasant parts of human nature and build a society based on cooperation and
solidarity. And if Europe can do it, then so can others. Maybe one day, before
I die, I’ll wake up in a socialist &lt;a href="http://www.socialisthistory.ca/Docs/CCF/ReginaManifesto.htm"&gt;Cooperative Commonwealth of Canada&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, much like the distribution of MPs between provinces in Canada, smaller countries are favoured, possessing more seats per capita than larger countries. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1.5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UKIP&lt;/span&gt; wants to replace the public health-care system with vouchers for private hospitals. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1.5" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policies of privatization, deregulation, budget cuts, decreased taxes (especially in the upper tax brackets), free trade, etc. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many left-wing thinkers nowadays argue that revolution doesn’t necessarily mean insurrection—it might simply refer to a period of rapid, fundamental change in society. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Right tends to become hysterical at this prospect, on the Left it is currently very fashionable to criticize &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SYRIZA&lt;/span&gt; for moving to the right. Personally, I’m not convinced that they’ve actually moved anywhere and think that any perception that they have is simply revealing what was always present in their ideology. For a good discussion of these issues, I recommend this lecture: &lt;a href="http://socialistproject.ca/leftstreamed/ls215.php"&gt;Syriza and the European Elections&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this are complicated, but they seem to include the fact that Britain lacks proportional representation and that the British Left is so notoriously fractious. It’s pretty bad when the Wikipedia’s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_political_parties#Minor_far-left_parties"&gt;list of British political parties&lt;/a&gt; needs a whole section just for the Far-Left.  &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

MacMackin</name></author><id>tag:politicalphysicist.github.io,2013-12-28:on-socialists-and-scotsmen.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Us socialists are often accused of preaching a failed ideology; one which has
been shown to inevitably result in totalitarianism and impoverishment. To this
most socialists will respond in one of two ways. Some (mostly those from the 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comintern"&gt;Third International&lt;/a&gt;, 
but also a few  radical elements of the 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_International"&gt;Second International&lt;/a&gt;) 
act as apologists for the old Eastern European regimes (and possibly those in
Asia as well, although the 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split"&gt;Sino-Soviet&lt;/a&gt; split complicates
matters there). Others, such as myself, respond by saying that we don’t see how
socialism can have failed when the world has yet to see a socialist society. This
tends to be the view of Trotskyist (such as those in one the various iterations
of the 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_International_(disambiguation)"&gt;Fourth International&lt;/a&gt;), 
libertarian socialists, and the more ideologically self-consistent democratic 
socialists. An example of such an argument is provided in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/K4Tq4VE8eHQ" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inevitable objection that is given, not only by the right but also by the
centre-left, is that this is an example of the “No True Scotsman Fallacy.”
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman"&gt;Wikipedia describes this&lt;/a&gt; like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No true Scotsman is an informal fallacy, an ad hoc attempt to retain an 
unreasoned assertion. When faced with a counterexample to a universal claim 
(“no Scotsman would do such a thing”), rather than denying the counterexample 
or rejecting the original universal claim, this fallacy modifies the subject of 
the assertion to exclude the specific case or others like it by rhetoric, 
without reference to any specific objective rule (“no true Scotsman would do 
such a thing”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, supposedly, it is logically invalid to explain away any unpleasantness
by dismissing the regime responsible as not really socialist. Doing so is to
dismiss counterarguments without actually addressing it. However, here I feel
that there is a misunderstanding of my point. These people misunderstand my 
argument to be “socialist societies will
inevitably be democratic ones.” However, for me, such a statement would be a
tautology: what I mean when I speak of socialism is “collective ownership of and
&lt;em&gt;democratic control&lt;/em&gt; over the economy.” For me 
(&lt;a href="http://socialistparty-usa.net/principles.html"&gt;and others&lt;/a&gt;), democracy is part 
of the definition of socialism. Any regime that claims to be socialistic but is a 
dictatorship (I’m looking at you, Cuba) is lying, at least by my definition
of socialism. True, such a regime might claim to be socialism, but that doesn’t
make it so; just because East Germany was called the German Democratic Republic
didn’t make it a democracy, after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some will claim that socialism will never be implemented democratically
because people won’t want it. Thus, socialism will inevitably have to be
imposed using violence and oppression. The first part of this argument is a
perfectly valid position to take, although not one that I think is true 
(actually, there is some historical evidence to the contrary, so anyone making
this argument will have to be very careful not to end up using  the “No True 
Scotsman Fallacy” themselves). However, in my view, the second part of this
argument is meaninglessness. If it is being imposed by a dictatorship then
it can not be socialism. Effectively what is being said, then, is that 
socialism is impossible. This is also a perfectly valid position, but I
don’t think that there is clear evidence one way or the other with regards
to this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, horrible things have been done &lt;em&gt;in the name of&lt;/em&gt;
socialism, and even quite recently the likes of Hugo Chavez have done some rather
slimy things in the name of socialism. This potential is something which socialists
must constantly be vigilant of. We must accept the ugly parts of our movement’s
history (and, for that matter, its present). Failure to do so is not only
dishonest, but dangerous. However, these dangers do not discredit socialism 
itself, but rather some (and, thankfully, an ever decreasing number) of the
social&lt;em&gt;ists&lt;/em&gt;. What’s more, I honestly believe that any risk of totalitarianism
posed by campaigning for democratic socialism is far smaller than the risks
that humanity face under capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for claims that socialism results in poverty: we have no data, seeing
as there have been no socialist economies (at least, not that have lasted 
for any significant amount of time before being crushed by external forces).
I don’t think that this will necessarily be the case, but that’s only a guess.
There’s no doubt that there were serious problems with the Warsaw Pact
economies. We have to seriously consider whether centralized planning can
ever be made to work (personally, I think that it would be undesirable even
if it could be done). Certainly, the planning techniques used by the Soviet Union
have been discredited. But I hope, and honestly believe, that in a technological, 
democratic society some form of 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_planning_(economics)"&gt;decentralized economic planning&lt;/a&gt; 
will be possible. Even if not, there are ideas such as cooperative ownership
in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism"&gt;market socialist&lt;/a&gt; economy,
which seem to me to be eminently feasible, if unambitious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, no, I am not committing the “No True Scotsman Fallacy” when I say that the
so-called communist countries were not, in fact, socialist. It is not a 
contradiction for me to
be a socialist and yet to oppose Soviet-style communism. It just so happens that
there are multiple definitions of socialism and the definition which applies to
me (and many others) is directly opposed to that used by the Soviet Union and
its supporters.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Socialism"></category><category term="No True Scotsmen Fallacy"></category><category term="Noam Chomsky"></category><category term="Democracy"></category></entry><entry><title>Denouncing the Dumb Diatribe on the Discontinuation of Door-to-Door Delivery</title><link href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/denouncing-the-dumb-diatribe-on-the-discontinuation-of-door-to-door-delivery.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-23T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2013-12-23T12:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>C.

that they will be making some changes. Two in particular are of note: a price 
increase on stamps and the phasing out of door-to-door delivery in urban 
areas. The latter measure will allow the elimination of about 8000 jobs. 
However, thanks to the strength of the postal workers’ union, no one will 
actually be fired; rather, the workforce reductions will be achieved by attrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Community mailboxes, of the sort I've grown up with." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/mailboxes.jpg"/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Community mailboxes, of the sort I’ve grown up with.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictably, the left has had a conniption over all of this. A typical example
can be &lt;a href="http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/views-expressed/2013/12/canada-post-not-on-life-support-it-being-murdered"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;. 
In particular, they have denounced the elimination of door-to-door delivery. 
Given my politics, you may be expecting a similar reaction here. But there 
you would be 
wrong. Many parts of Canada already use the community mailboxes which will 
become the norm over the next few years. It so happens that I grew up in one 
such area. It was a daily routine to either walk and get the mail or to swing 
by the mailbox when we were driving somewhere. In the case of the latter, the 
community mailbox arrangement took at most an extra two minutes out of our 
day. In the case of the former, it forced us to get a bit of fresh air and 
exercise. Contrary to what many claim, the scheme is not particularly 
inconvenient* and certainly is not going to cause the destruction of Canada Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, if anything the opposite is true. Sometimes people will talk about 
ending Canada Post’s monopoly and introducing competition into mail 
delivery. I
tend to be suspicious of such proposals, but if the proper regulations
were in place then I find it hard to actually justify the government monopoly 
on door-to-door daily mail delivery. Community mail boxes, however, make this
much more difficult in my opinion. Do we really want to allow every upstart
mail-delivery company to have the keys to everyone’s mailboxes? I think that
would be rather hard to justify (especially given that the mailboxes are
government property) and could thus potentially reinforce Canada
Post’s monopoly status. It obviously would be no protection against 
privatization, but in the current political climate I don’t know what can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the far more concerning element of the reforms is the increase in the
price of postage. Again, I doubt that this will spell the end of a public post
office, but it is nonetheless a significant increase. Prices will be going up
by 22 cents when buying stamps in packs and by 37 cents when buying
individually (although most people protesting the changes are only 
bothering to
mention the higher of these two figures). Given that Canada Post’s delivery
times are, let’s face it, less than impressive, cheapness is one of the few 
things it has going for it. It perplexes me that the prices increases seem to
be of secondary concern to those on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, this whole thing perplexes me to some extent. As I mentioned 
earlier, community mailboxes are not exactly new; large parts of Canada have
been using them for years. If they are such a terrible idea, why the hell are
we only hearing it now? Are the people who intend to protest the post office
changes going to push for the elimination of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; community mailboxes and the
restoration of universal door-to-door delivery? Somehow I doubt it. And which
of the other cost-saving proposals would they endorse? Reducing delivery to
three days a week seems like a much worse option to me. As does closing post
offices, which are a fantastically valuable piece of 
infrastructure which have 
the potential to perform many useful functions. I don’t much like the idea
of wage reductions or restraint and, in any case, that would be difficult
given the strength of the postal union (although knowing Harper he might just
legislate it through). Prices increases certainly aren’t ideal, 
as I’ve already
said. Community mailboxes seem like a pretty reasonable solution, given that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it ideal? Not really. There’s no denying that door-to-door delivery 
is more 
convenient. And, even if the job reductions are done by attrition, I’m not 
thrilled with a reduction in the size of the public sector. It’s yet another
reduction in the role played in the economy by Crown corporations, further
removing from people’s consciousness the idea of public enterprise performing
a useful function. (Particularly disturbing is that the government has
appointed a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; of Canada Post who came from a company that operates
privatized post offices.) What’s more, 
there are alternatives to the reduction in
service, other sources of revenue which Canada Post could pursue. Post offices
could take over some of the functions of Service Canada, for example. It would
be far more convenient for people, considering there are many more 
post offices than Service Canada bureaus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But far more interesting is the potential for
Canada Post to offer banking services, as described in 
&lt;a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/12/20/postal_savings_bank_could_save_mail_delivery_walkom.html"&gt;this Toronto Star article&lt;/a&gt;. 
This isn’t nearly as strange an idea as it seems, as postal banks are
common in Europe and other parts of the world. 
In fact, Britain’s old Gyro Bank—the name of their postal bank—
was (prior to its privatization in the ‘80s) possibly the single most 
successful example of public enterprise, introducing many innovations and 
scaring the private banking sector into shaping up its act.
A similar scheme in
Canada would be an excellent idea even on its own merit. It could likely
offer Canadians superior levels of service (certainly many more branches) than
existing banks currently provide and could be used to invest in 
socially useful projects.
What’s more, it would almost certainly provide Canada Post with 
enough revenue 
to make the current service reductions unnecessary. Perhaps it would be enough
to pay for universal door-to-door delivery (although I honestly have no idea 
about that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there’s no doubt that there are alternatives to the service reductions at
Canada Post. Ones that would promote socialist ideals such as 
public ownership. But I honestly don’t see these service reductions as 
leading to the destruction or privatization of Canada Post. They will, at 
worst, be a minor inconvenience for Canadians. Let’s try to keep things in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*I should note here that the changes will more troublesome for seniors. 
Perhaps there could be a compromise made where you get door-to-door delivery
if you are over a certain age? But in any case, most seniors who live in 
their own houses are fairly spry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Canada Post"></category><category term="Crown Corporations"></category><category term="Door-to-Door Mail"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Social Democracy Was Great and Why It Isn’t the Answer</title><link href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/why-social-democracy-was-great-and-why-it-isnt-the-answer.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-07-13T23:40:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-07-13T23:40:00+01:00</updated><author><name>C.

glance would appear to be entirely unrelated. One was in &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929254.600-the-wonder-year-why-1978-was-the-best-year-ever.html#.UeCPGt9hLCc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
magazine and explained that, although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; has risen fairly steadily in the west for the past several decades, the Genuine Progress Indicator (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPI&lt;/span&gt;) has slowly 
been declining since 1978. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPI&lt;/span&gt; essentially tries to
adjust the value of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; to account for social and environmental problems (such 
as inequality and pollution). The other article was an opinion
piece in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/25/europe-leaders-not-turning-austerity"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by two Canadian academics and activists
that I am rather fond of: Leo Panitch and Sam Gindin. Here they explained why 
we can’t expect any attempt at a second New Deal in Europe as a way of 
combating the economic crisis: in short, without a
threat of something more radical (ie: all-out socialism), the ruling classes see
no need to engage in progressive economic policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Graphs show that GDP has been consistently rising since 1950, while GPI has 
been in decline since the late 1970s." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/gpiPlots.jpg"/&gt;
This set of graphs, taken from &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;‘s website, shows that global &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;
and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPI&lt;/span&gt; rose fairly steadily from 1950 to the late 1970s. 
This corresponds with the period in which Keynesianism ruled. This usually
took the form of social democracy: public ownership of key industries, strong 
trade unions, lots of regulation, a large welfare state, etc. As Panitch and
Gindin explain, the reason that this could be implemented was because there
were powerful working-class forces at work which could have led to the outright
abolition of capitalism. Faced with the prospect of losing everything, the upper
classes were willing to sacrifice a little wealth and power in order to pacify
the lower classes. This also was reflected in American foreign policy: the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;
established the Marshall Plan in Europe to ensure that capitalism survived 
there, thus helping to ensure its survival in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the above plot, these policies were quite successful at 
ensuring increased quality of life for all. However, the welfare state was 
always dependent on the success in the private sector for revenue (with a few
exceptions, nationalised industries were not used as major revenue sources). 
Thus social democracy has always been dependent on continued capital 
accumulation. And this was its fundamental weakness. When the global slump
came in the 1970s (in Britain it was so severe that you see a large decrease
in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPI&lt;/span&gt; around 1975) it began to put the welfare state in jeopardy. In some 
countries there were attempts to break away from the dependence on private
capital accumulation (the Meidner Plan in Sweden and Mitterrand’s 
nationalisation of banks in France) but the working class was not strong enough
to bring these attempts to a successful conclusion. In all countries it 
eventually proved necessary
to start scaling back the welfare state and, to one degree or another, abandon
Keynesian policies in favour of Monetarist ones. This new economic orthodoxy is
usually referred to as neoliberalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Britain this took the form of Margaret Thatcher. In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; it was Ronald
Reagan. In Canada it was Brian Mulroney. All of them implemented policies which
were harmful to the average citizen. Trade unions were weakened and could no
longer act as a force against income inequality. Industries previously devoted
to the public good were privatised and used to enrich a select few. Cuts to 
social spending hurt the poor by making once universal services available only
to those that could pay. Deregulation made it easier for companies to pollute
the environment and the emphasis on private profit meant that environmental
costs were ignored. The reasons for declining &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPI&lt;/span&gt; are clear. What is less clear
is what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panitch and Gindin show that today we lack the popular forces which made 
social democracy viable in the post-war period. There are no significant 
examples of non-capitalist states and few radical trade unions. In the minds of
most people there is no alternative to capitalism. Anti-capitalist parties are 
small and marginal (with a few exceptions, such as in Greece and, to a lesser 
extent, Spain and Portugal). The business class need not
fear the imposition of socialism; they know that the working class is currently
too disorganized to be a serious threat and thus see no need to pursue a policy
of appeasement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this situation will very likely change in the coming years and 
decades, but there are a few questions we should address as we work to create 
new working-class institutions. One is what these movements should demand. 
Many progressive economists talk about things like reregulating the banks and 
implementing a Tobin tax. However, as
explained above, we are unlikely to be able to impose these reformist measures
without the threat of something far more radical. And, knowing what happened the
last time the left settled for reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it, 
we should not be content merely to use socialism as a threat. This time we must
&lt;em&gt;implement&lt;/em&gt; it.
Social democracy died in the 1980s and there is no point in trying to bring back
the dead. Rosa Luxemburg’s sentiments are more true now than ever:

For those
of you who don’t know, Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; during
the ‘80s and oversaw the implementation of neoliberalism. She succeeded in 
crushing the trade unions, scaling back the welfare state, deregulating the
financial sector, deindustrialising Britain, and privatising a substantial
portion of public assets (including utilities, airlines, buses, coal mines,
steel manufacturing, and aerospace, among other things). These policies saw a 
massive increase in income inequality and unemployment and are often referred
to as “class warfare from above.” Anyway, I received a 
(fairly typical) response that Thatcher saved Britain for anarchy and bankruptcy
and that while her policies were unpleasant at the time, they were 
necessary. There are even plenty of people
on the centre-left who say things like this. It irritates me to no end, but I 
figured that it was best to avoid getting dragged into a political debate in 
public. Of course, this being me, it continued to bother me through the day, so
I’ve written some of my thoughts on the matter here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to be fair, Britain’s economy was a mess before she came in. It was also a 
mess for quite awhile after she came in. In fact, initially she made things 
worse. When the recovery did come it was on the back of the finance “industry,”
and we all know how that turned out… However, there is no denying that the
British economy was in need of major restructuring. Maggie famously justified
her policies by saying that “There is no alternative.” This is often referred to
as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TINA&lt;/span&gt; and this is what the Thatcher-apologists have unwittingly bought into. 
And, in a sense, they aren’t wrong. There was no alternative—if we insisted on
maintaining capitalism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, at about the same time that the Thatcherites came to
power we also saw the rise of the Bennites. They were a left-wing movement 
within the Labour Party, centred around the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP&lt;/span&gt; Tony Benn. They advocated 
nationalising the financial institutions
and much of large industry. These new public enterprises were to be administered
by the workers. They felt that these measures, combined with a degree of
industrial planning (which would, if I recall, have seen a substantial retooling
of factories) and import substitution would help to restart Britain’s
economy. Actually, the Labour Party was elected in the 1970s on a watered-down
version of this platform. However, they did not have the guts to pursue it and
instead implemented an early, watered-down version of Thatcherism. This prompted
a massive strike-wave, referred to as The Winter of Discontent (the 
anarchy to which Thatcher apologists refer). The irony is that the Labour 
Party brought it upon themselves. There were alternatives proposed. At least one
was even put forward the Cabinet by Tony Benn, but was viewed as too radical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you can not justify what Margaret Thatcher did by saying that it was what 
was necessary in order to get Britain back on track. There were other options
available which were never tried. What was true, however, was that the post-War
class-compromise (the Keynesian mixed-economy) had outlive its usefulness. As 
the ‘80s dawned, class struggle was destined to begin anew. 
The likes of Tony Benn tried, 
and very nearly succeeded, at leading the working class to victory. 
However, Mrs. Thatcher was more successful with her ruling-class offensive.
When you apologise for Thatcher, this class warfare from above is what you are 
justifying. I suspect, or at least hope, that
fewer people would be willing to defend her if they thought of it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;: I have a certain fondness for all of the protests songs written about
Margaret Thatcher. Here are a few of my favourites:&lt;/p&gt;
