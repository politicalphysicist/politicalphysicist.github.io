[minutes for the February AMM]({filename}amm-9feb2018-minutes.docx)
were approved with minor corrections. AGM minutes are approved next
year but a brief review was given.


##Matters Arising and Urgent Business

None.


##Local Elections

Gained ground among young voters and Greens, while Lib Dem vote went
up in some of the more affluent area. Lost one seat to the Lib
Dems. Lots of thanks for door-knockers, etc. More wards were
campaigned in and more new candidates put forward than ever
before. Best ever result since current wards were created and have
highest share of council seats ever. Campaign organiser
has been offered a permanent position. Increased ethnic diversity and
number of people with disability on the council, while number of women
stayed the same. In Kidlington the Lib Dems and Greens teemed up which
cost us some. Was an issue with housing where Greens said nothing in
the greenbelt, full stop, whereas Labour was more pragmatic. The
Green position was more popular locally. Cherry suggested we may be
able to start making progress in Oxford West and Abingdon, having won
a seat there for the first time. In North ward Oxford sent long
letters whereas Lib Dems had shorter and more memorable
leaflets. Housing is important to keep campaigning on, as that's what
wins in many areas (even Tories had to pay lip service to it). Asked
for posters explaining why people do telling so people realise why
they're being asked how they vote and that this means they won't be
bothered later by door-knockers. Mentioned that Lib Dems are really
good self-publicists and their leaflets can make a really big
difference. In particular, they are very professional looking.


##Parliamentary Report

Long printed report was provided (as it has been two months since the
last one). Spring Statement (talking about state of the economy)
happened which showed that austerity has not worked, long term
problems persist, growth rates have to be adjusted down, growth rates
poorer than other countries, etc. Labour argues government should look
at these stats and reverse course. Should remove changes to banking
levy (which returns money to profitable banks) and use money for
children's services. 1/3 of councils are saying they can not properly
provide these statutory services. Want government to look at funds for
local government which have been slashed (claiming they can always
raise council tax, despite them then campaigning against Labour on
this basis). Wrong decision to cut stamp duty for first time buyers,
because without more houses all it does is push up prices. Now need to
develop a more detailed Labour policy on housing (one has now been
released--I remember seeing some on the Left being disappointed by
it). Wants a local event to get people's expertise involved.

Managed to get a win on tax transparency for overseas
territories. Will mean transparent property registers will now be
required, allowing us to see what oligarchs own things where.

Was a Customs Union vote in Parliament, which passed unanimously
(because Tories boycotted, knowing they would loose--similar thing
happened on Universal Credit). Government is ignoring it. MPs insist
some electronics at the border can sort it out. Cuts to HMRC would
make it very difficult to implement new customs control as well.

She knew of Windrush, having helped some constituents with it. Have
managed to get some people out of trouble, but setting up a special
surgery to try to get in contact with _everyone_. Want an enquiry to
find out exactly how this happened, who's been deported, etc.

Treasury team is trying to develop the plans for government and this
will continue over summer. Locally she hopes we can develop links with
other councils and constituencies to help more marginal areas get
elected. 

Question on whether the finance team could try to come up with ways to
continue the Iran agreement without (in spite of) US. Alternative
currencies to buy oil? Emily Thornberry spoke very harshly about it
and we should continue to support it but need to think in practical
terms. Banks are nervous about having activity in countries with US
sanctions. Anneliese will try to raise the issue in Parliament.

I asked about member involvement in policy formation. Deferred to Ann
on NPF process. Shadow Treasury policy making does have various events
which can be attended. Will be a state of the economy event next
Friday. Mentioned that manifesto was popular so feels there is a
mandate to develop that further, but member consultation obviously
needed when new directions taken. Ann agreed that NPF documents were
not useful but pledged to improve things as newly elected chair.

Someone asked about children denied free school meals if in immigrant
family. Labour government on these issues and how government
accounting works in this regard.

Question on what Labour will do to commemorate anniversary of
Grenfell. Planning is underway on this. Wants to focus on changing the
system so fire can't happen again and survivors will be properly
looked after. Government not giving straight answers on fire
regulations and whether they apply to private housing. Also refusing
to pay councils that have replaced flammable cladding.

Someone asked what an adequate response to Windrush would
be. Compensation is being mentioned, but that doesn't seem
sufficient. No one listened to those speaking out about the issue and
it took investigative journalists to bring it out. Referenced a few
good speeches in Parliament we should listen to (David Lamb, Dianne
Abbott, someone else). Reports of how awful and arbitrary the Home
Office is. Any compensation will have to cover less tangible losses
(health, broken families, etc.). Most important thing is to find out
how it happened and make sure Amber Rudd isn't just the scapegoat. It
was Theresa May who was the architect of the system and she seems to
be getting away with it.


##Oxford East NPF 

Tom Hayes (not the Momentum candidate) won the vote 26-13.


##Party Democracy Review

[A report](DemReview2.docx) from the meeting we had on Part II of the
review was submitted to the party.

We broke into groups to discuss electing the leadership (from party 3
of the review). We were given a set of questions to consider. There
were a couple, for if we had the time, dealing with the NEC. However,
there is absolutely no mention of policy formation. Ann explained that
this is because it's something most people understand and there are a
small number of finite options on which we can vote. Groups will
discuss it and propose any other options they can think of after we
reconvene, then vote on it.

In the meeting we decided on:

- OMOV, with some people emphasising the role for trade unionists
- A percentage of MPs/CLPs with CLPs having equivalent status
- Overall voted against registered supporters 33-24 (didn't split
  cleanly along left/right lines)
- No vote on how much registered supporters pay, due to previous
- Multiple suggestions that only those who were members when
  leadership election called should vote in it,
  which ultimately won 39-19 (latter for no qualifying period)

Surprised to see John Tanner opting for the less democratic choices.


##Motions

###Trans women and all-women shortlists

The motion we passed at SWC branch finally came to the debate. John
Tanner spoke for it as proposer. Liz seconded and also spoke,
emphasising we want to forward it to the relevant section of the
party. Ann said NEC will be trying to come up with new wording to
satisfy all involved. She will take the motion to the meeting in the
spirit it was submitted. Two spoke in support, none against. Passed
unanimously.


###Anti-semitism motion

Ann felt there were so many amendments to (each different) that it was
worth passing it back to the proposers and the amenders, to try to get
it reformed and with no more than two amendments. We will vote on it
next time. The party's General Secretary sent some
[guiding notes](ant-semitism.docx) to all CLP secretaries for
discussing this topic.


##Executive Committee Report

We received minutes from the last EC meeting. Stephen Marks announced
an economics day school on 23 June, which is mentioned in the
minutes. Will be looking at childcare as a generator of jobs and
the topic of precarious work.

Agreed next meeting will be on 14th June (in Abingdon) and then 13th
of July.
