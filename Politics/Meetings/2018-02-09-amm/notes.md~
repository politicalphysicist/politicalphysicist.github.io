Summary: An all members meeting with a presentation on Brexit. This was followed by a motion on Brexit, along with motions on various other issues (including a somewhat contentious one on Haringey). There was also a parliamentary report.

[Minutes of last meeting]({filename}amm-12jan2018-minutes.docx) were
approved, as was the [agenda for this meeting]({filename}amm-9feb2018-agenda.docx).

At start of the meeting we had to decide whether to debate a motion on
the NHS or on Haringey (both submitted by the same branch). Haringey
was selected.

##Giampi Alhadeff, Speaking on Brexit

General secretary of the European Parliamentary Labour Party. Started with lots of waffle, country divided, etc. Identified 4
issues:

1. The union of the UK (due to the Northern Ireland situation),
   especially with the Good Friday agreement.
2. Jobs and prosperity. Was at lots of WTO summits (including Seattle)
   and the negotiators are tough. Trade with other countries will hurt
   British sectors, losing jobs. Can't make up EU trade with overseas
   trade. Any international business will move out (according to
   Japanese Ambassador)
3. Health & safety, workers' rights, and the environment. This is what
   the right-wingers talk about when they mean "red tape". Want a
   Singapore for European (which won't happen, but anyway). UK will
   diverge with EU as latter introduces new laws.
4. Big issues facing the world: China developing internationally,
   Russia and its meddling abroad, climate change, artificial
   intelligence (peace, business, war, etc.)

Leaving the EU will impact the UK's ability to deal with these
issues. It will address them but the UK won't have a voice.

Problem for Labour is 2/3 or members want to remain while 2/3 of
constituencies want to leave. He believes Labour must say that regions
which voted leave will be hit hardest, so let's remain.


##Brexit Motion

A range of views on this. I pointed out some of the downsides of the
EU. It was amended to remove the talk of a second referendum. The
motion now reads "This meeting believes that the Labour Party's policy
on Brexit should be to remain in the Customs Union". This was
overwhelmingly carried
with about 17 votes against and 15 abstentions. Many questioned what
the point of the motion was given that the customs union doesn't exist
as an institution. Liz noticed that a lot of Momentum people voted for
the motion.


##Parliamentary Report from Anneliese Dodds

Praised that we had such a passionate but still civil debate on
Brexit. Thinks party should press harder on the customs union issue
because government is currently week on that, especially with the EU
expressing doubts about the whole situation in Ireland. Has been
arguing in parliament to support at least _a_ and possibly _the_
customs union so that Tories will split on it. Also wants to maintain
unity, as election could be coming earlier than expected.

Managed to get a vote against a tax treaty rejected, as these are used
for tax avoidance (in the guise of international aid). A few similar
bills which were coming up seem to have vanished... Also pushing
transparency for trust. Other EU countries are coming out against that
but not the UK. The lack of transparency is abused for money
laundering, etc. Dealing with some tax issues, particularly how
raising the income tax threshold has _not_ (as the government likes to
pretend) solved poverty. Cuts to benefits have had a much bigger
impact. Pushing on the NHS as the winter crisis is far worse than in
previous years. Sent out an emergency budget for health which showed
where money could be found to help address these issues. Managed to
get a requirement that homes be fit for habitation, now need to make
sure tenants can actually exercise those rights.

Some discussion of Helen and Douglas House (a local hospice). It seems
to be having to close a lot of services because there is no public
money going into it. Talk about trying to get the CCG to reconsider
given the situation. Meeting gave unanimous permission to send a
letter in our name.


##Motions

###Afrin

Materials were circulated about this. Basically this is Turkey
attacking the Kurdish, YPG-controlled areas in northern Syria. Lots of
war crimes, civilian deaths, targeting of women. No one from
international community has spoken up, so the drafter put forward this
motion. Turkey seems to be trying to annex and ethnically cleanse
it. Boris Johnson has effectively supported the invasion saying
Turkey has a right to keep its borders secure. Emotional pleas to
help. One speaker checked to ensure her ammendment noting how the UK
is a NATO member was included (it was) and anther spoke in favour. The
motion was unanimously carried.


###Haringey and the NEC

Pointed out how HDV is a continuation of the disastrous privatisation
agenda which Labour now opposes. Haringey's attempt at the HDV split
the council and went against CLPs, MPs, unions. NEC intervened on
behalf of councillors and union members in a very measured
manner. This was all within party rules. Critics have gained massive
coverage in the media, so important to put our views forward. Dan
seconded and drew attention to how broad the opposition to the HDV
is. Motion through the NEC was unanimously supported (after an
amendment). Luke Akehurst spoke against, claiming not because he
supported HDV but because the it fell within spectrum of allowable
policies to be decided on a local level. Nonetheless seemed to speak
in support of the HDV. Claims new council houses, even under Labour,
will be built privately. Another person said it wasn't our place to
stick the oar in. Others pointed out that our council leader was one
of those condemning the NEC, making it our business. Overwhelmingly
carried with 6 against and 20 abstentions. 


###Rough sleeping

Cherry informed me a row is brewing over the provision of this to open
shelters when even one night is predicted to be below freezing (rather
than 3 consecutive nights). The Labour Club says won't support any
candidates failing to support this, while the council is saying won't
support candidates who are in favour of it. Momentum councillors (and
prospective councillors) are willing to break rank on this, but best
to get this through at the CLP level to try to force council's
hand. Richard presented the Southwest Central motion on rough
sleeping. Made a positive case for it, emphasised working with
council, not trying to be confrontational. A Momentum member
(forgotten her name) proposed ammendments supporting rights of
"non-statutory homeless" and civil rights of homeless, which Richard
accepted. These were accepted. Deputy-leader of the council
spoke. Says will be a church open for rough sleepers every night
through January to March. To date have had enough capacity. Says SWEP
is inefficient way of doing things and could make it difficult to
extend current scheme. Will still vote for motion, but shouldn't get
too caught up on SWEP. Unanimously carried.


##Executive Committee Report

We were sent the [full report]({filename}ec-minutes-18jan2018.docx) in
advance.  Advertised dinner with Keir Starmer. Unfair dismissal rally
tomorrow in support of GMB taxi drivers, marching from city council to
Osney. Speakers on Afrin offering to speak at branch
meetings. Finally, were some forms to join Labour Movement for Europe
(I did not sign up).


##NEC Report

Left as had to leave to let cold weather shelters set up. In advance
we were sent one report by
[Ann Black]({filename}nec-jan2018-annblack.docx) and another by
[Pete Willsman]({filename}nec-jan2018-petewillsman.docx).
