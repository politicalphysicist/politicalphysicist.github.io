##Matters Arising and Urgent Business

None.

##National Nominations

These were moved ahead to give more time to count ballots (unanimously
approved). Late arrivals will be able to submit ballots right until
the originally scheduled time.

##Treasurer's Report

Had £15k more income than anticipated, due to the general
election. About £5k more was spent than expected due to the election,
although lost the organiser so savings on payroll. Surplus of £9000,
although £3000 deferred expenditure to pay salary of
organiser. Surplus largely due to large donation from a
union. Projecting balanced budget for this year. Increased income
donated by Labour Group of councillors. More money will be spent on
conference delegates (sending two rather than one). Want to keep
things reasonably solid so can do the campaigning they want without
having to worry about cost. Accounts unanimously approved.

##Officers' Report

These were one of the email attachments (which I didn't read). The
chair gave a brief summary of her report. She was pleased to fight on
a "socialist" manifesto and see how popular it was. She was pleased at
how all of the 10 key positions in the local party/government are
filled by women. Thanked retiring council leader. Congratulated
equalities commission and diverse slate of candidates, though we can't
rest on our laurels. Talked about how to broaden support and campaign
beyond canvassing. Talked about needing to be welcoming to everyone
and respectful of all views. Team will try to be inclusive. Thanked
Ann Black for her hard work.

No objections to the reports.

##Amendments to Rules and Standing Orders

Andrew Smith proposed changes to campaign committee, though Ann spoke
on it. Only meets 3 times a year and operates on ad-hoc basis, but has
become something of a club of friends. Want to formalise it. Spending
decisions will be OKed by the GM. All branches will now send
representatives. No questions or challenges were made and it was
passed overwhelmingly.

##Election of Officers and Delegates

Almost all posts were uncontested. One of the challengers for the BAME
Officer withdrew, so that is no longer contested (Momentum candidates
winning by default). We will hear speeches from trade union
officer. At least one conference delegate must be female. Conference
delegates are elected by first past the post. Luke Akehurst asked
about run-off voting and said it should be done this way in
future. Ann Black rebuked him as having ample opportunity to raise
such a procedural issue and FPTP has always been used in the past so
it's not like it's a surprise.

Mark Ladbroke (incumbent) spoke about how trade unionists are transformative and
how nice it is to be in a position which allows him to work with those
who are actually fighting back. Has worked on living wage campaign,
including with competitor. Said up to Peter if wants to continue
working jointly with him in future.

Peter Nowland  who I don't recognise) said would
like to work with Mark to get unions back into workplaces fighting for
better conditions.

Unclear whether were proposing job-sharing. Ann seemed to indicate it
would be working together on a more informal basis, as they had not
been nominated on a jobshare. At last minute the two candidates did
agree to jobshare, so no contested positions.

Couldn't be bothered to take detailed notes on conference delegate
speeches. 

##Oxford City Labour Group

This was a report sent with the email. The council leader was here to
take any questions, but there didn't appear to be any.

##Oxfordshire County Labour Group

Again, the report was in our papers. The leader of the group wasn't
here, but a councillor was present to take questions. She started by
noting that the group managed to get £500k maintained in homelessness
services. Also that voted against Tory idea of giving some new central
government money to councillors to administer, instead wanting it to
go to children's services.

##Parliamentary Report

Anneliese's report didn't seem to make it to me, somehow. She started
by mentioning the Oxfam crisis, as they are a major employer in the
city. Employees admitted bad mistakes were made, but expressed concern
that the Right is using it as an excuse to gut foreign aid,
particularly where it involves more political charities such as
Oxfam. The minister claims no weaponisation of the issue, but
Anneliese feels this is not her experience. Also stressed that lessons
need to be learned beyond just the charity structure.

Reiterated that Corbyn has committed to membership of "a" customs
union, saying she thinks this is the right decision and what she hoped
Labour would move to. Also campaigning against the government using
Brexit as an attempt to grab power and avoid parliamentary
scrutiny. Recently the government has tried to water down anti-money
laundering laws and Anneliese thinks they might be able to pull some
Tories towards them on this.

Shadow treasury team is preparing for spring statement. Supposedly
will be no changes to spending etc. in it, but will reveal the bad
state of the economy. Tories will try to spin it as not as bad as
everyone thought, but it is still bad. Hoping can use this as an
opportunity to push them on council funding. Cuts to taxes benefiting
companies and the rich were made at the same time council funding was
drastically cut. Those decisions will have long-term costs for our
communities.

John Tanner asked when Labour will come out in favour of single market
membership. Anneleise felt the UK will be "rule-takers" whether in
single market or not. Seems to indicate single market membership is
her preferred option.

Someone else asked whether the number of Tory councils facing
bankruptcy might force the government to soften its
approach. Apparently MPs are trying to bring this up with
Conservatives. They just say "councils can raise council tax", which
is cynical for obvious reasons. Would mean those on low income would
be paying for central government tax.

Was a question on homelessness; something about it's relation to
national policy. Theresa May seemed to be trying to spin action as
helping with homelessness, nut planning bill doesn't really change
power imbalance between councils and developers. Trying to give
free-market solutions to a problem that requires public action.

Someone from student union asked about what Labour is doing locally
and nationally to support UCU strike. Anneleise noted how she was a
lecturer and as, a student, managed to get USS ethically invested. As
such she is appalled by what UUK is doing to it now. Has been asked to
sign an early day motion on this, but as a front-bencher she has to be
told to do so by whips. She hopes she will be allowed to sign it soon.

Someone brought up university hospitals where, in exchange for 2% pay
rise for next 3 years staff are being asked not to take annual
leave. This, of course, is leading to even deeper
demoralisation. Labour feared this sort of thing when Tories formally
removed pay cap a few months ago. In any case, that's a
below-inflation pay rise. Where pay rises do occur, it seems to come
out of services, but Labour has shown that cancelling tax cuts would
allow everyone to have proper raises. She met with CCG recently but
stressed they are between a rock and a hard place. Conservatives
claiming problems in Oxford are just down to local management not
adopting Tory policies is absurd. Someone pointed out lots of people
are doing unpaid work already and Anneliese agreed the NHS is just
running on goodwill and if there were work to rule the whole thing
would fall apart.

##Motions

###Eastern Ghouta

Ann acted as proposer because the proposers in the branch
were absent. This was asking Corbyn to condemn Assad's action in one
region. I don't know what to think of this one, given that it's a war
against ISIS, etc.

Someone spoke against (also did so at branch, but was caught by
surprise then). He said he knows this was tabled with good intentions,
but believes that in the context we should oppose it. Said Boris
Johnson is threatening airstrikes in Syria and Trump wants to start a
war somewhere. Had two parliamentary debates on action in Syria over
last few years. This motion would help provide a pretext for western
bombing. Said these are the kinds of arguments which led to disaster
in Iraq and Libya.

Someone said we need to do something, which I find unconvincing.

Another person insisted this does not provide a pretext for
international intervention. Said Assad is responsible for the vast
majority of civilian casualties, according to Amnesty International.

Luke Akehurst said in motions we should vote for what is written on
paper. No reason not to vote for calling for immediate ceasefires and
humanitarian corridors. Only military intervention mentioned in motion
is that of Russia.

Someone claimed motion is completely unbalanced for condemning what
Russia is doing but not Al Queda for controlling regions and refusing
to let civilians leave. Felt is was one-sided because of this.

Didn't count number in favour. 11 against and "more than a dozen
abstentions". I abstained. Passed overwhelmingly. I couldn't quite tell, but I
think Liz voted for.

###NHS

Jane Stockton spoke as mover for this, noting that she hopes it isn't
controversial. Calls on party at local level to act against 5 year
plan for NHS and introduction of "accountable care
organisations". These bodies have the power to call for changes to be
halted and reviewed at a higher level. This is in line with national
policy. We need to act now to prevent damage being done before Labour
makes it into power. In other areas nearby we have seen such action be
successful. Have failed to halt privatisation and downgrades, so must
do more.

A speaker (consultant at the hospitals) emphasised that narrative we
hear of needing to carry out central government policy is false. In
other areas there has been management resistance, but needs to be
popular pressure.

No one wanted to speak against. Passed unanimously.

###Immigration

This seemed like quite a sensible motion asking for a proper debate in
the party on immigration and the different types of immigration. Was
based on a discussion in the branch. Couldn't really do a complicated
issue like this through a simple motion. Want to use leavers of the
party (NPF, etc.) to get a proper discussion going, with goal of
bringing something to Conference in 2019. Pointed out that for most
people immigration is a secondary issue. Speaker says Labour should be
a party that welcomes immigrants, but need a proper policy on it.

Someone spoke against language which suggests good immigrants and bad
immigrants and proposed that sentence be removed. Another felt motion
was poorly worded, unclear, and can reproduce negative ideas on
UK. Pointed out a number of problematic sentences. Felt motion
emphasised what is good for country (vague) but not what's good for
immigrants. Said language of compassion is in contradiction with
things which continue to support border regimes. Wants to have free
movement (what with "migration crisis") paid for by taxing the global
rich. More people wanted to speak against, but standing orders
required any additional speakers to be in favour for reasons of
balance. 

In the end, John Tanner asked for motion to be returned to branch to
remove problematic wording. This was accepted.

##Results of Elections and Nominations

For Oxford East conference delegates there was a 3-way tie between
Becky, Dan, and Marie, so we had to do a revote. Results were somewhat
delayed as they were not finished yet.

While we waited we heard from the taxi driver (can't remember name and
don't see it written down) who was fired for being a trade union shop
steward. Reported on how his tribunal over this was a failure. Will be
launching an appeal.

Both CLPs nominated the entire left slate for NEC (plus Ann
Black). Oxford East for NPF had 3 of the left slate but a recount is
needed for the last one (youth is uncontested). West NPF nominations
were also left slate. Oxford East conference delegates: Becky and a
tie between Dan and Marie. There was a runoff, but at the end of the
meeting there was still a tie. Since some delegates had left by the,
the GM decided (by popular request) to look at whether they could
afford to spend all 3. In West, at least one and possibly both of the
Momentum candidates were chosen as delegates.

I missed this result on the night but I found out the next day that
bot CLPs voted against nominating an NCC candidate. Only a candidate
from the right was on the ballot, so this is what Momentum wanted in
order that we'll have a chance to nominate someone from the left at
the next meeting.
