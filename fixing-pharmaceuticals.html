            <p><img alt="Mortar and pestle--the symbol for pharmacies in Canada." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/mortarPestle.jpg" />
Several weeks ago, now, I read a news story on <span class="caps">CBC</span> about the
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/drug-shortages-worsening-as-health-canada-starts-study-to-address-it-1.2652581">problem of drug shortages</a>.
It appears that it is not uncommon for pharmaceutical companies (I&#8217;m going to
avoid the term &#8220;Big Pharma&#8221; here, as to me it always sound like a juvenile
attempt at fear-mongering) to suddenly stop, or at least drastically scale down,
production of frequently used drugs. Unfortunately, no real solutions were
being offered to this. At most, Health Canada was trying to make it mandatory
for the manufacturers to report&nbsp;shortages.</p>
<p>This is by no means the only problem that exists with pharmaceutical companies.
I vaguely remember hearing several years ago on an American news channel that
many companies were no longer producing generics, as they are not very
profitable. Of course, generics are a lot cheaper for consumers, as they are
not subject to the legal monopoly of patent law. Patents themselves are
problematic as they increase prices, but some form of patent protection seems
to be needed in order to encourage innovation and the development of new
drugs by the private&nbsp;sector.</p>
<p>But even patents aren&#8217;t always enough to encourage the research we need. This
became clear in a recent report by <span class="caps">CBC</span> that pharmaceutical companies
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/antibiotic-scientist-must-push-discovery-to-market-1.2686347?cmp=rss">do not seem to be interested in developing new antibiotics</a>.
The reason for this is that this is quite a research-intensive process with
relatively low returns, as antibiotics aren&#8217;t used that much compared to
medication for chronic conditions. However, it is absolutely vital that new
antibiotics are developed as old ones are becoming ineffective against
antibiotic-resistant&nbsp;bacteria.</p>
<p>The problem is becoming so acute that even
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/">New Scientist</a>, a liberal but hardly a socialist
publication, published an editorial calling for all pharmaceutical companies
to be converted non-profit bodies charged with pursuing the public interest.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
Whether this meant nationalization or simply conversion to independent
non-profit organizations (or some mixture of the two) I am not sure.
In any case,
I strongly support such a demand and think that it would be enormously
beneficial. Those who know me well won&#8217;t be surprised by this, as it seems that
my response to just about any problem that I see in the economy is to
nationalize the relevant sector.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p>However, in this case I am perfectly willing to call for a more pragmatic
solution&#8212;at least for the time being. Given how important a steady supply of
drugs is to the healthcare system, you don&#8217;t want to do anything that could
seriously disrupt their production. Also, this is a problem which really does
need to be fixed as soon as possible and, while the nationalization of a whole
sector would never win broad support in the near future,<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> a more
moderate idea might. Not to say that this idea isn&#8217;t radical given the current
political climate, but it is something which could be justified based on
pragmatism and could still seem at least vaguely conceivable to the general&nbsp;public.</p>
<p>My proposal is fairly simple: the creation of a new Crown Corporation.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Since
most people my age won&#8217;t know what this is (it having been so
long since any new ones have been created) I&#8217;ll explain: a Crown Corporation is
a companies which, rather than being owned by private individuals or listed
on the stock market, is owned by the government. The only significant example
in Nova Scotia is <span class="caps">NSLC</span> (the liquor stores). In most of Canada (although not Nova
Scotia) the power companies are owned by the provincial government.
Federal Crown Corporations include Canada Post, <span class="caps">CBC</span>, and Via Rail.
We used to own a lot more too: <span class="caps">NS</span> Power, Air Canada, the Uranium mines,
Canadian National Railway, and  Petro-Canada, among others. However,
these were sold
off in the &#8216;80s and &#8216;90s, purportedly to improve the efficiency of these
companies although I&#8217;m inclined to think that it was primarily for ideological&nbsp;reasons.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to my point. I think that the government should create a new Crown
Corporation which, for the sake of argument, I shall call Pharmacy Canada.
Pharmacy Canada would be charged with the development of new drugs which would
tend to have a low rate of return on investment (such as antibiotics) as well
as producing generic drugs. These would be sold at cost to the provincial health
authorities. They could also be sold slightly above cost to other developed
countries and, perhaps, at a subsidized rate to developing countries. An
additional role that could be played by Pharmacy Canada would be to act as a
bulk-purchaser of those drugs which still needed to be obtained from the
private sector. These would then be sold on, at cost, to the provinces as well.
The advantage of such centralized purchasing that it would place
Pharmacy Canada in a position to negotiate lower prices. This is a system
which has been used successfully by charities to deliver cheaper drugs to
developing countries and is, in fact, called for by the Green Party (although
no doubt they would balk at the idea of actually <em>producing</em> drugs in the public
sector). All of these policies would help to reduce the price of drugs,
stabilizing the
fastest growing component of healthcare costs and making our public healthcare
system more&nbsp;sustainable.</p>
<p>This is all eminently achievable even within the current political situation.
While it would, no doubt, be heavily lobbied against by the pharmaceutical
companies, I don&#8217;t see what they could actually do to prevent it. I suppose they
could retaliate through capital flight, although I don&#8217;t see how this would be
in their interest. If they were to try then their old factories could be bought
up by Pharmacy Canada, thus protecting jobs. While setting up a new Crown
Corporation would require some capital, interest rates remain low and the
federal government has a high credit rating, allowing it to borrow cheaply.
The federal deficit is almost gone and we could be running a substantial
surplus if we were to return taxes to their 2000 levels. Thus I don&#8217;t think that
there is any real financial argument against establishing Pharmacy&nbsp;Canada.</p>
<p>The primary objection to this would be ideological: the belief that the
government is not capable of running a successful, productive, company. Such
attitudes are wide-spread, even among liberals and social democrats (e.g. the
<span class="caps">NDP</span>). While there have been some issues with Crown Corporations in the past, I
still think that they were much better run than people give them credit for.
They may not have had the profit margins of private enterprise, but this is
because they were meant to be meeting social, not just purely economic
objectives. Objecting to this (as is done by my father) is to miss the entire
purpose of a Crown Corporation; if you wanted it to be run just like a private
company then you&#8217;d have left it in the private sector in the first place.
Although Pharmacy Canada wouldn&#8217;t deliver the same profit margins as the
existing private pharmaceutical companies, it would be able to perform
functions which they are
failing to do. This sort of value can not be reflected in simple calculations
of&nbsp;efficiency.</p>
<p>While I suspect that the traditional means of running Crown Corporations<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> would be able to achieve much of what I describe, I believe that
even greater accomplishments could be made if Pharmacy Canada were to be run
along socialist lines. This would mean that the board would consist of
representatives of researchers, doctors, employees, patients, and government.
The advantages to this are twofold. First,
and more abstractly, it would ensure that the company was run democratically,
something which I think has value in its own right. But second, the
representation of researchers and doctors would ensure that fruitful avenues of
research were being pursued. My strong suspicion is that this would prove a
mores successful (as measured in health outcomes, rather than profit) way of
directing research than what is currently provided by the private&nbsp;sector.</p>
<p>Now, being the realist/cynic that I am, I realize that the creation of Pharmacy
Canada stands absolutely no chance of happening even if the <span class="caps">NDP</span> were elected
in 2015. The idea of public enterprise has simply crept too far outside of the
political mainstream. But this is no reason to stop talking about it; if it is
ever to get back into the political mainstream then it is something which must
become broadly popular and also seriously discussed in progressive political
circles. We need organizations like <a href="https://www.broadbentinstitute.ca/en">The Broadbent Institute</a>,
the <a href="http://www.canadians.org/">Council of Canadians</a>, and the
<a href="https://www.policyalternatives.ca/">Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives</a>
not only to call for such a policy but to perform studies detailing how to do
it. Nor should we be afraid to suggest it as individuals. Because, at least in
this case, the radical is becoming the&nbsp;pragmatic.</p>

<p>I do realize that this alone won&#8217;t fix all of the problems, as democratic control is needed over public enterprise if it is to truly behave differently than private enterprise (other than just behaving slightly more bureaucratically).
