approved (with national nominations moved ahead to give extra time for
counting) as were the
<a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/agm17min.docx">minutes for the previous <span class="caps">AGM</span></a>. </p>
<p>Note that votes on officers, nominations, etc. were done by
<a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/agm-9mar2018-dels.docx">branch delegates</a>
only. <a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/agm18-rules.docx">Full rules</a> for the <span class="caps">AGM</span> were sent
in advance.</p>
<h2>Matters Arising and Urgent Business</h2>
<p>None.</p>
<h2>National Nominations</h2>
<p>These were moved ahead to give more time to count ballots (unanimously
approved). Late arrivals will be able to submit ballots right until
the originally scheduled time. See the
<a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/agm18-nc-nominations.docx">list of candidates</a> to the
national positions, with candidate statements and lists of those
nominating them to the <span class="caps">AGM</span>.</p>
<h2>Treasurer’s Report</h2>
<p>Had £15k more income than anticipated, due to the general
election. About £5k more was spent than expected due to the election,
although lost the organiser so savings on payroll. Surplus of £9000,
although £3000 deferred expenditure to pay salary of
organiser. Surplus largely due to large donation from a
union. Projecting balanced budget for this year. Increased income
donated by Labour Group of councillors. More money will be spent on
conference delegates (sending two per <span class="caps">CLP</span>, rather than one). Want to
keep things reasonably solid so can do the campaigning they want
without having to worry about cost. Accounts unanimously approved.</p>
<h2>Officers’ Report</h2>
<p><a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/agm18-officers-reports.docx">These reports</a> were sent in
advance (I didn’t read them). The chair gave a brief summary of her
report. She was pleased to fight on a “socialist” manifesto and see
how popular it was. She was pleased at how all of the 10 key positions
in the local party/government are filled by women. Thanked retiring
council leader. Congratulated equalities commission and diverse slate
of candidates, though we can’t rest on our laurels. Talked about how
to broaden support and campaign beyond canvassing. Talked about
needing to be welcoming to everyone and respectful of all views. Team
will try to be inclusive. Thanked Ann Black for her hard work.</p>
<p>No objections to the reports.</p>
<h2>Amendments to Rules and Standing Orders</h2>
<p>Andrew Smith proposed
<a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/agm18-camp-comm-members.docx">changes to campaign committee</a>,
though Ann spoke on it. Only meets 3 times a year and operates on
ad-hoc basis, but has become something of a club of friends. Want to
formalise it. Spending decisions will be OKed by the <span class="caps">GM</span>. All branches
will now send representatives. No questions or challenges were made
and it was passed overwhelmingly.</p>
<h2>Election of Officers and Delegates</h2>
<p>We were sent a
<a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/agm18-nominations.docx">list of nominated candidates</a> in
advance. More detailed
<a href="agm18-candidates-statements.docx">candidate statements</a> were also provided.</p>
<p>Almost all officer posts were uncontested. One of the challengers for the <span class="caps">BAME</span>
Officer withdrew, so that is no longer contested (Momentum candidates
winning by default). We will hear speeches from trade union
officer. At least one conference delegate must be female. Conference
delegates are elected by first past the post (<span class="caps">FPTP</span>). Luke Akehurst asked
about run-off voting and said it should be done this way in
future. Ann Black rebuked him as having ample opportunity to raise
such a procedural issue and <span class="caps">FPTP</span> has always been used in the past so
it’s not like it’s a surprise.</p>
<p>Mark Ladbroke (incumbent) spoke about how trade unionists are transformative and
how nice it is to be in a position which allows him to work with those
who are actually fighting back. Has worked on living wage campaign,
including with competitor. Said up to Peter if wants to continue
working jointly with him in future.</p>
<p>Peter Nowland  who I don’t recognise) said would
like to work with Mark to get unions back into workplaces fighting for
better conditions.</p>
<p>Unclear whether were proposing job-sharing. Ann seemed to indicate it
would be working together on a more informal basis, as they had not
been nominated on a jobshare. At last minute the two candidates did
agree to jobshare, so no contested positions.</p>
<p>Couldn’t be bothered to take detailed notes on conference delegate
speeches. Some were obvious Corbynites, some were obvious
anti-Corbynites. Most were a bit more guarded on these issues. I
already knew who were the Momentum candidates.</p>
<h2>Oxford City Labour Group</h2>
<p><a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/agm18-oxford-city-council-report.pdf">This report</a> was
emailed sent with the email. The council leader was here to take any
questions, but there didn’t appear to be any.</p>
<h2>Oxfordshire County Labour Group</h2>
<p>The report was supposed to have been sent in advance, but I couldn’t
find it. The leader of the group wasn’t here, but a councillor was
present to take questions. She started by noting that the group
managed to get £500k maintained in homelessness services. Also that
voted against Tory idea of giving some new central government money to
councillors to administer, instead wanting it to go to children’s services.</p>
<h2>Parliamentary Report</h2>
<p>Anneliese’s printed report didn’t seem to make it to me, somehow. She started
by mentioning the Oxfam crisis, as they are a major employer in the
city. Employees admitted bad mistakes were made, but expressed concern
that the Right is using it as an excuse to gut foreign aid,
particularly where it involves more political charities such as
Oxfam. The minister claims no weaponisation of the issue, but
Anneliese feels this is not her experience. Also stressed that lessons
need to be learned beyond just the charity structure.</p>
<p>Reiterated that Corbyn has committed to membership of “a” customs
union, saying she thinks this is the right decision and what she hoped
Labour would move to. Also campaigning against the government using
Brexit as an attempt to grab power and avoid parliamentary
scrutiny. Recently the government has tried to water down anti-money
laundering laws and Anneliese thinks they might be able to pull some
Tories towards them on this.</p>
<p>Shadow treasury team is preparing for spring statement. Supposedly
will be no changes to spending etc. in it, but will reveal the bad
state of the economy. Tories will try to spin it as not as bad as
everyone thought, but it is still bad. Hoping can use this as an
opportunity to push them on council funding. Cuts to taxes benefiting
companies and the rich were made at the same time council funding was
drastically cut. Those decisions will have long-term costs for our communities.</p>
<p>John Tanner asked when Labour will come out in favour of single market
membership. Anneleise felt the <span class="caps">UK</span> will be “rule-takers” whether in
single market or not. Seems to indicate single market membership is
her preferred option.</p>
<p>Someone else asked whether the number of Tory councils facing
bankruptcy might force the government to soften its
approach. Apparently MPs are trying to bring this up with
Conservatives. They just say “councils can raise council tax”, which
is cynical for obvious reasons. Would mean those on low income would
be paying for central government tax.</p>
<p>Was a question on homelessness; something about it’s relation to
national policy. Theresa May seemed to be trying to spin action as
helping with homelessness, nut planning bill doesn’t really change
power imbalance between councils and developers. Trying to give
free-market solutions to a problem that requires public action.</p>
<p>Someone from student union asked about what Labour is doing locally
and nationally to support <span class="caps">UCU</span> strike. Anneleise noted how she was a
lecturer and as, a student, managed to get <span class="caps">USS</span> ethically invested. As
such she is appalled by what <span class="caps">UUK</span> is doing to it now. Has been asked to
sign an early day motion on this, but as a front-bencher she has to be
told to do so by whips. She hopes she will be allowed to sign it soon.</p>
<p>Someone brought up university hospitals where, in exchange for 2% pay
rise for next 3 years staff are being asked not to take annual
leave. This, of course, is leading to even deeper
demoralisation. Labour feared this sort of thing when Tories formally
removed pay cap a few months ago. In any case, that’s a
below-inflation pay rise. Where pay rises do occur, it seems to come
out of services, but Labour has shown that cancelling tax cuts would
allow everyone to have proper raises. She met with <span class="caps">CCG</span> recently but
stressed they are between a rock and a hard place. Conservatives
claiming problems in Oxford are just down to local management not
adopting Tory policies is absurd. Someone pointed out lots of people
are doing unpaid work already and Anneliese agreed the <span class="caps">NHS</span> is just
running on goodwill and if there were work to rule the whole thing
would fall apart.</p>
<h2>Motions</h2>
<h3>Eastern Ghouta</h3>
<p>Ann acted as proposer because the proposers in the branch
were absent. This was asking Corbyn to condemn Assad’s action in one
region. I don’t know what to think of this one, given that it’s a war
against <span class="caps">ISIS</span>, etc.</p>
<p>Someone spoke against (also did so at branch, but was caught by
surprise then). He said he knows this was tabled with good intentions,
but believes that in the context we should oppose it. Said Boris
Johnson is threatening airstrikes in Syria and Trump wants to start a
war somewhere. Had two parliamentary debates on action in Syria over
last few years. This motion would help provide a pretext for western
bombing. Said these are the kinds of arguments which led to disaster
in Iraq and Libya.</p>
<p>Someone said “we need to do something”, which I find unconvincing.</p>
<p>Another person insisted this does not provide a pretext for
international intervention. Said Assad is responsible for the vast
majority of civilian casualties, according to Amnesty International.</p>
<p>Luke Akehurst said in motions we should vote for what is written on
paper. No reason not to vote for calling for immediate ceasefires and
humanitarian corridors. Only military intervention mentioned in motion
is that of Russia.</p>
<p>Someone claimed motion is completely unbalanced for condemning what
Russia is doing but not Al Queda for controlling regions and refusing
to let civilians leave. Felt is was one-sided because of this.</p>
<p>Didn’t count number in favour. 11 against and “more than a dozen
abstentions”. I abstained, feeling I had insufficient knowledge to
judge. Passed overwhelmingly. I couldn’t quite tell, but I think some
Momentum members voted for.</p>
<h3><span class="caps">NHS</span></h3>
<p>Jane Stockton spoke as mover for this, noting that she hopes it isn’t
controversial. Calls on party at local level to act against 5 year
plan for <span class="caps">NHS</span> and introduction of “accountable care
organisations”. Labour-controlled bodies mentioned in the motion, such
as the city council, have the power to call for changes to be
halted and reviewed at a higher level. This is in line with national
policy. We need to act now to prevent damage being done before Labour
makes it into power. In other areas nearby we have seen such action be
successful. Have failed to halt privatisation and downgrades, so must
do more.</p>
<p>A speaker (consultant at the hospitals) emphasised that narrative we
hear of needing to carry out central government policy is false. In
other areas there has been management resistance, but needs to be
popular pressure.</p>
<p>No one wanted to speak against. Passed unanimously.</p>
<h3>Immigration</h3>
<p>This motion called for proper debate in
the party on immigration and the different types of immigration. Was
based on a discussion in the branch. Couldn’t really do a complicated
issue like this through a simple motion. Want to use leavers of the
party (<span class="caps">NPF</span>, etc.) to get a proper discussion going, with goal of
bringing something to Conference in 2019. Pointed out that for most
people immigration is a secondary issue. Speaker says Labour should be
a party that welcomes immigrants, but need a proper policy on it.</p>
<p>Someone spoke against language which suggests good immigrants and bad
immigrants and proposed that sentence be removed. Another felt motion
was poorly worded, unclear, and can reproduce negative ideas on
<span class="caps">UK</span>. Pointed out a number of problematic sentences. Felt motion
emphasised what is good for country (vague) but not what’s good for
immigrants. Said language of compassion is in contradiction with
continuing to support border regimes. Wants to have free
movement (what with “migration crisis”) paid for by taxing the global
rich. More people wanted to speak against, but standing orders seemed
to require any additional speakers to be in favour for reasons of balance.</p>
<p>In the end, John Tanner asked for motion to be returned to branch to
remove problematic wording. This was accepted.</p>
<h2>Results of Elections and Nominations</h2>
<p>For Oxford East conference delegates there was a 3-way tie between
Becky, Dan, and Marie, so we had to do a revote. Results were somewhat
delayed as they were not finished yet.</p>
<p>While we waited we heard from the taxi driver (can’t remember name and
don’t see it written down) who was fired for being a trade union shop
steward. Reported on how his tribunal over this was a failure. Will be
launching an appeal.</p>
<p>Both CLPs nominated the entire left slate for <span class="caps">NEC</span> (plus Ann
Black). Oxford East for <span class="caps">NPF</span> had 3 of the left slate but a recount is
needed for the last one (youth is uncontested). West <span class="caps">NPF</span> nominations
were also left slate. Oxford East conference delegates: Becky and a
tie between Dan and Marie. There was a runoff, but at the end of the
meeting there was still a tie. Since some delegates had left by the,
the <span class="caps">GM</span> decided (by popular request) to look at whether they could
afford to send all 3. In West, at least one and possibly both of the
Momentum candidates were chosen as delegates.</p>
<p>I missed this result on the night but I found out the next day that
bot CLPs voted against nominating an <span class="caps">NCC</span> candidate. Only a candidate
from the right was on the ballot, so this is what Momentum wanted in
order that we’ll have a chance to nominate someone from the left at
the next meeting.</p>
<p>We were sent <a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2018-03-09-agm/results.zip">official results</a> the next day.</p>
