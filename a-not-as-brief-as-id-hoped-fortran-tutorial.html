            <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> I wrote this guide for the Saint Mary’s University Astronomy and
Physics Society to go along with a tutorial that I will present on the Fortran

<p>Fortran, which stands for FORmula TRANslator, is the oldest high level
programming language and remains, albeit with significant improvements,
one of the main languages used by physicists.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
Most computational physics is done using Fortran and this is the language
typically used in <span class="caps">SMU</span>’s Computational Methods for Physicists class. This
introduction will show you how to use various useful features of the language
in its modern form.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> It will do this by defining a problem which we wish a

if you want to follow along (which I’d recommend
doing). I assume that you already know how the basics of computer programming
but have not previously done scientific computing or worked with Fotran. Of
course, this will only be a taste of Fortran’s abilities and there will be
many features, both simple and complex, which I will not be able to mention.

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Say we’ve measure the electric potentials at various points in one dimension.
We have recorded the location at which the measurement was taken and the value
of the potential in a file on our computer. We now want to calculate the
electric field that exists at each point where we took a measurement. These
results will be printed to a second text file on the computer. The program
should also find the average electric field and the standard deviation.</p>
<p><a name="method"></a></p>
<h4>The Numerical Method</h4>
<p>To do this, we need to recall that
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \mathbf{E} = -\nabla V. $$</div>
<p>
In our simple, one dimensional case, this becomes
</p>
<div class="math">$$ E = -\frac{dV}{dx}. $$</div>
<p>
However, we don’t actually know the function <span class="math">\(V(x)\)</span>, only the value of <span class="math">\(V\)</span> at
particular values of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. So, how do we calculate the derivative? In reality,
we’ll have to estimate it. The limit definition of the derivative says
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \frac{dV}{dx} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{V(x + h) - V(x)}{h}, $$</div>
<p>
so you might be tempted to use
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \frac{dV_{i}}{dx} \approx \frac{V_{i+1} - V_{i}}{x_{i+1} - x_{i}}. $$</div>
<p>
However, that is only accounting for the rate of change on one side of your
data-point, <span class="math">\(i\)</span>. Thus, it would be better to use
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \frac{dV_{i}}{dx} \approx \frac{V_{i+1} - V_{i-1}}{x_{i+1} - x_{i-1}}. $$</div>
<p>
Of course, this won’t work at two ends of the data set, so in those cases we’ll
simply have to make do with half of the information and use something along
the lines of our first guess of how to take the derivative.</p>
<p><a name="stats"></a></p>
<h4>Statistics</h4>
<p>As I hope everyone will know, the average value of some data is given by
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \overline{x} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i~. $$</div>
<p>
As a reminder, the standard deviation of a data-set is
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2}.$$</div>
<p><a name="algorithm"></a></p>
<h3>The Algorithm</h3>
<p>The basic structure of our program will be as follows</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the files from which to read and to which to write data.</li>
<li>Read the data from the input file.</li>
<li>Take the derivative of the data and multiply by negative one.</li>
<li>Write the processed data to the output file.</li>
<li>Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the processed data.</li>
<li>Print these statistical values to the screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>The calculations in steps 3 and 5 are to be done using the techniques and
equations discussed in the previous section.</p>
<h3>A Note on Style</h3>
<p><a name="style"></a>
Fortran, as a language, is case-insensitive. This means that  “<span class="caps">HELLO</span>”,
“hello”, and “hElLo” are equivalent. The original standard style for programming
in Fortran was to use all upper-case letters. Personally, I find this hard to
read. Many people, today, will use entirely lower-case letters, and some will
use a mixture of both. I have read that the standard now is to use
upper-case letters for anything that is intrinsic to the language, and
lower-case letters for everything else. Although it is debatable how many
people actually stick to this, I will be using this style throughout this
tutorial. Note that case-insensitivity does not apply to the contents
of strings.</p>
<p><a name="comments"></a></p>
<h3>Comments and White-Space</h3>
<p>From Fortran 90 onward, comments are designated by an exclamation mark.
Anything on a line following an exclamation mark (assuming that the
exclamation mark isn’t inside a string) will be ignored by the
compiler. Comments should be used to document your code. I’d recommend
having a standard template that you use at the top of each program
explaining what it does. An example of the format I use is provided below.</p>

<p>The Fortran 90
standard saw the adoption of free-form programming. This means that you
can insert any number of blank lines that you like between successive lines
of code and that there can be as many spaces as you like within a line of code.
Note, however, that most compilers will place a limit on the number of
characters that you may have in a line; often this is 132 characters. In
any case, it is bad style, in my opinion, to have lines longer than about
80 characters.</p>
<p><a name="basics"></a></p>
<h3>Fortran Basics</h3>
<p>Before we fully begin, there are a few more things I want to discuss. These are
some of the fundamental concepts seen in every programming language. I’m going
to assume that you are familiar with these principles and will just show
how they are applied in Fortran.</p>
<p><a name="structure"></a></p>
<h4>Basic Program Structure</h4>
<p>The great advantage of Fortran is the fairly obvious meaning of all of its
syntax—something which can emphatically <em>not</em> be said for C. The
basic structure of our program will be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">PROGRAM </span><span class="n">potential_field</span>
    <span class="k">IMPLICIT NONE</span>

    <span class="c">! Variable declarations</span>
    <span class="c">! ...</span>
<span class="c">!---------------------------------------!</span>

    <span class="c">! Main program</span>
    <span class="c">! ...</span>

    <span class="k">STOP</span>
<span class="k">END PROGRAM </span><span class="n">potential_field</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The first line says that you are writing a stand-alone program (as opposed to,
say, a subroutine) called “potential_field”. <code>IMPLICIT NONE</code> instructs the
compiler to give an error message if it
encounters any variables which haven’t been declared. This should always be put
at the start of programs in order to prevent bugs occurring due to typos in
variable names. After this we would declare our variables and then would come
the program itself. <code>STOP</code> stops the
execution of the program and the final line designates the end of the program
within your text file. You are then free to write any procedures you want
below that. Unlike many other programming languages, Fortran does not allow
anything in your source file to fall outside of a program unit—that is, outside
of a program, subroutine, function, or module (more on the latter three later).</p>
<p><a name="variables"></a></p>
<h4>Variables</h4>
<p>Fortran has five fundamental data-types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>INTEGER</code>s are integer values, which can be represented exactly by the computer.</li>
<li><code>REAL</code>s are floating point numbers, representing real numbers. They are not
  exact representations of real numbers, having only a finite number of decimal places.</li>
<li><code>COMPLEX</code> variables are effectively just two real variables, one storing
  the real component of a number, the other storing the imaginary component.
  These don’t need to be used very often.</li>
<li><code>CHARACTER</code>s are text characters, usually encoded as <span class="caps">ASCII</span>. Character
  variables can be given a length, allowing them to be used as strings.</li>
<li><code>LOGICAL</code>s are boolean variables, which can store a value of either
  <code>.TRUE.</code> or <code>.FALSE.</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also define “derived types,” which are the equivalents to structs in
C or objects/classes in other languages. These are only really needed in
larger programs, where they can provide a useful way of organizing
data and code.</p>
<p>A sample of the variable declarions in our code are given below.</p>

</pre></div>
<p>The ampersands indicate line continuation.</p>
<p><code>CHARACTER(LEN=32)</code> means that these variables are strings containing 32
characters. The <code>PARAMETER</code> attribute means that the variable is a constant,
whose value is set at declaration. <code>REAL(8)</code> means that this is an 8-byte real
variable (the equivalent of a <code>double</code> in C), which provides about twice the
precision of a standard <code>REAL</code> variable. The <code>DIMENSION()</code> attribute
indicates that this variable will be an array. The number inside the parentheses
is the length of the array. It must either be a literal or a parameter.
You can also have multidimensional arrays, which are declared with a
<code>DIMENSION(dim1,dim2,dim3,...)</code> attribute. By default, Fortran arrays are
indexed starting at 1, unlike most other languages. On a technical note,
they are stored in column major order rather than the more typical
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-major_order">row major order</a>.</p>
<p><a name="conditional"></a></p>
<h4>Conditional Statements</h4>
<p>If you want a single line to be executed only if <code>&lt;condition&gt;</code> is true, you
would use the following syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">IF</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">condition</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">statements</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The general form for an if-statement is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">IF</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">condition</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">THEN</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">statemtents</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">ELSE IF</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">condition2</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">THEN</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">statemtents</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">ELSE IF</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">condition3</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">THEN</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">statemtents</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">ELSE</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">statemtents</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">END IF</span>
</pre></div>
<p>There can be an arbitrary number of <code>ELSE IF</code>s, including zero. The <code>ELSE</code>
statement is optional, but if it is used then it must come at the end.</p>
<p><code>&lt;condition&gt;</code> is a <code>LOGICAL</code> variable or a logical test. The logical
operators in Fortran are <code>==</code>, <code>/=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>,
<code>&lt;=</code>, <code>.NOT.</code>, <code>.AND.</code>, <code>.OR.</code>, and <code>.XOR.</code>. The meaning of all of
these is what
you would expect, except possibly for <code>/=</code>, which corresponds to “not equal
to.” Fortran can not use <code>!=</code> because the exclamation mark is the symbol for
a comment.</p>
<p><a name="loops"></a></p>
<h4>Loops</h4>
<p>The main type of loop which you’ll use in Fortran is a “do-loop,” the equivalent
of a for-loop. This takes the form</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">DO </span><span class="nb">index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">lower</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">upper</span><span class="p">[,</span> <span class="n">step_size</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">statements</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">END DO</span>
</pre></div>
<p>where <code>index</code> is the counter variable in the loop, <code>lower</code> is the
lower bound, <code>upper</code> is the upper bound, and <code>step_size</code> is the increment
by which to increase the index. The upper and lower bounds are inclusive.</p>
<p>There are also while loops, which have the syntax</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">DO WHILE</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">condition</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">statements</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">END DO</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You can exit a loop with the command <code>EXIT</code>, or skip to the next iteration
with the command <code>CYCLE</code>. The <code>EXIT</code> command allows us to use the loop structure</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">DO</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">statements</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">END DO</span>
</pre></div>
<p>which would otherwise be an infinite loop.</p>
<p><a name="instructions"></a></p>
<h3>Getting Instructions from the User</h3>
<p>We need our program to read in data provided by the user. The best way to do
this is to read it from a text file. We could simply “hardcode” into the
program the name of the file in which the data is to be placed. However,
it would be preferable if the user were to be able to over-ride this default.
The same applies for the file to which we want our results to be written.
We could simply ask the user for the file names when the program is running,
but this is rather ungainly. A far nicer solution is for the user to, if they
desire, specify the file names as command-line arguments. To accomplish this
we use the following bit of code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">num_args</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">IF</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">num_args</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">CALL </span><span class="nb">GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">infile</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">IF</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">num_args</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">CALL </span><span class="nb">GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">outfile</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The first line here asks for the number of command-line arguments which
have been provided. If any have been then the first will be the file
containing the data to be read in and we will place that data in the
appropriate string variable (<code>infile</code>). If there is also a second argument
then it will
be the name of the file to which to output the data, and it will also
be placed in the appropriate variable (<code>outfile</code>). The default input
and output file names were assigned when <code>infile</code> and <code>outfile</code> were declared.</p>
<p>In this snippet of code there are a few things worth noting.</p>
<ol>
<li>I make use of two intrinsic procedures: the function
<code>COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT</code> and the subroutine <code>GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT</code>. I will
explain subroutines and functions in more detail soon. These two procedures
happen to be part of the Fortran 2008 standard. Most compilers featured
equivalent functions prior to the 2008 standard, but there was never any
guarantee that they would be the same between compilers.</li>
<li>We encounter variable assignment in the first line. This is unremarkable
and just like every other high-level programming language. Values are
also assigned in second and third line, but to the arguments of a subroutine.
More on that in a bit.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="reading"></a></p>
<h3>Reading and Writing Data</h3>
<p>Now that we know the names of the input and output files, we want to write
the code needed to actually perform input and output. If there was one
thing that I could change about Fortran, it would be how it does <span class="caps">IO</span>; the
technique it uses is old-fashioned and extremely clunky.</p>
<p>First, we must open a file. To do this, we use the command
<code>OPEN(unit, FILE='&lt;filename&gt;'[, &lt;other options&gt;])</code>. The unit is an integer,
specifying which <span class="caps">IO</span> “stream” we want to use. There are a few which are reserved:
0 for standard-error, 5 for standard-in, and 6 for standard-out. You should
use a positive integer less than 100. Perhaps the most important of the
other options which may be used when opening a file is <code>STATUS="..."</code>. The
string may be set to “unknown,” indicating that we don’t know whether or not
the file already exists, “new,” indicating that the file should <em>not</em> already
exist, or “old,” indicating that the file <em>should</em> already exist. You may
also use the option <code>IOSTAT=variable</code>, where <code>variable</code> should be an
integer. If, after the operation has been completed, <code>variable</code> is equal to
zero, then it was successful. Otherwise, it indicates that there was an error
of some sort. Without specifying an <code>IOSTAT</code> the program would crash on you.</p>
<p>To open our input file, we use the code</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">! Read in data from the input file</span>
<span class="k">OPEN</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">UNIT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">FILE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">infile</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">IOSTAT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">ioval</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">STATUS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'old'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">IF</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">ioval</span> <span class="o">/=</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">THEN</span> <span class="c">! Make sure file exists</span>
    <span class="k">WRITE</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">filedne</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nb">TRIM</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">infile</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">STOP</span>
<span class="k">END IF</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The statements within the if-statement will write an error message and then
stop the program if there was some problem opening the file.
We see here our first example of actual <span class="caps">IO</span>. This is done by the <code>WRITE</code>
statement, which is writing a message to standard error. The next argument,
<code>filedne</code> is a format
string. I won’t go into detail about how these work—you can Google it if
you’re interested. Essentially, all that they do is specify how to format the
output of any variables provided. In this case that
variable is <code>TRIM(infile)</code>, where <code>TRIM()</code> is a built-in function which
strips any trailing spaces from the string. Instead of using a format string,
you can just replace the variable name with an asterisk, causing Fortran to
automatically format your output for you. This is often sufficient and we
will see examples of it below. The general form for output statements is
<code>WRITE(&lt;unit&gt;,&lt;format-string&gt;) &lt;variables...&gt;</code>. Here, <code>&lt;variables...&gt;</code>
are the variables whose values are to be outputted.</p>
<p>Next we’ll read in the data. Input statements are very similar to output
statements, except that <code>WRITE</code> is replaced with <code>READ</code>. The general form
is <code>READ(&lt;unit&gt;,&lt;format-string&gt;) &lt;variables...&gt;</code>. In this case, the input
data will be placed into the variables we specify in <code>&lt;variables&gt;</code>. Input
is done line-by-line with as many variables filled as possible, given the
amount of data on the line. For input you should almost always use an asterisk
instead of a format string. An additional argument which can be provided for
<code>READ</code> statements is an <code>IOSTAT</code>. This works in exactly the same way as
in the <code>OPEN</code> statement and can be useful to know when you’ve read to the
end of a file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">DO </span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">data_max</span> <span class="c">! Read until end of file or reach maximum amount of data</span>

<span class="k">    END IF</span>
<span class="k">    IF</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">data_max</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">WRITE</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s1">'POTENTIAL_FIELD: Could not read '</span><span class="o">//</span>   <span class="p">&amp;</span>
        <span class="s1">'all input data. Truncated after '</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">data_max</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">' elements.'</span>
<span class="k">END DO</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This bit of code will read in as much data from the file as we have room for in
our arrays, storing it in the arrays <code>postn</code> and <code>potntl</code>. If it reaches
the end of the file then it will remember the amount of data read in and exit
the loop. If it reaches the end of the array then it will print a warning
message saying that some of the data may have been truncated. The two slashses
that you see in the <code>WRITE</code> statement are the concatenation operator.</p>
<p>Now that we’re done with the input file, we’ll close it using the command
<code>CLOSE(&lt;unit&gt;)</code>. In this case we simply add the line <code>CLOSE(10)</code>.</p>
<p>After all of this, outputting our results will seem easy. This is done
with the following code fragment which will go after the actual calculations
in our program</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">! Send the data to the output file</span>
<span class="k">OPEN</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">FILE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">outfile</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">STATUS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'unknown'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">END DO</span>
<span class="k">CLOSE</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>There is little to remark upon here, except to note that the first line
we write to the file is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#Position                   Field Strength
</pre></div>
<p>This provides a header for the file. Most pieces of plotting software know to
ignore lines beginning with a hash-sign. Thus, this provides a way to remind
yourself what the data in your file are, without getting in the way if you want
to make a graph from it. I consider it to be good style to put such a header
at the top of all of your data files.</p>
<p><a name="procedures"></a></p>
<h3>Procedures</h3>
<p>When writing a program, it is often useful to place some of your code into
subprograms. There are two main reasons for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>It allows the code to be executed multiple times without having to be
   rewritten each time.</li>
<li>It allows the code to be reused in future programs.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Fortran we call these “procedures.” In most languages they are called
“methods.” Fortran has two types of procedures: functions and subroutines.
Functions produce a value and are akin to the methods that you see in
other languages. Subroutines do not produce a value and are similar to void
methods in other languages.</p>
<p>It is best to place any procedures at the end of your program. Just below
where your program ends (after the <code>STOP</code> command) type a line containing only
the word <code>CONTAINS</code>. Place your procedures below that and before the end of
the program.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">PROGRAM </span><span class="n">potential_field</span>
    <span class="k">IMPLICIT NONE</span>

    <span class="c">! Variable declarations</span>
    <span class="c">! ...</span>
<span class="c">!---------------------------------------!</span>

    <span class="c">! Main program</span>
    <span class="c">! ...</span>

    <span class="k">STOP</span>
<span class="k">CONTAINS</span>
    <span class="c">! Subroutines and functions</span>
    <span class="c">! ...</span>

<span class="k">END PROGRAM </span><span class="n">potential_field</span>
</pre></div>
<p>There is another way to package procedures, using “modules.” I’ll
explain those later. I should also mention that it is possible to place your
procedures entirely outside of any program or module and in older versions of
Fortran this was the only option. However, unless you need to do this in order
to work with some legacy code, this is not a practice that I would
recommend.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
When procedures are stored in this way, the compiler won’t be able to check
that you have passed the correct number and types of arguments and these bugs
are, in my experience, immensely frustrating to catch.</p>
<p><a name="pass"></a></p>
<h4>Pass by Reference</h4>
<p>In most programming languages, when you pass a variable to a method as an
argument, a new
copy of that variable is created for the method to use. This variable will
then be deleted once the method has finished executing. This technique is call
“pass by value.” Fortran, however, works differently. Instead of creating
a copy of the passed variable, the procedure will be told where the original
variable is located and will then access the original whenever the variable
is used. This is called “pass by reference.”</p>
<p>If you are only using the variable’s value as input then this is irrelevant to
the end user. However, if you modify the value of an argument in the procedure,
then that modification will be reflected in the  calling
program once the procedure has finished executing. At the end of the day, what
this means is that we have a way for procedures to return multiple pieces of
information. This also means that whether you use a function or a subroutine
is entirely a matter of taste. Typically, I will use a function if I only
want to return a single value. They are particularly useful for representing
mathematical functions in numerical routines such as root-finders, integrators,
<span class="caps">ODE</span> solvers, etc. I use a subroutine if I know that I want to return multiple
variables. You will see an example of each in the program we are writing today.</p>
<p><a name="functions"></a></p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>I wrote a function to calculate derivatives. The basic syntax
for such a function is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">FUNCTION </span><span class="n">differentiate</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">independent</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dependent</span> <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">IMPLICIT NONE</span>
    <span class="c">! Argument declarations</span>
    <span class="kt">REAL</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="k">DIMENSION</span><span class="p">(:),</span> <span class="k">INTENT</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IN</span><span class="p">)</span>   <span class="kd">::</span>  <span class="n">dependent</span><span class="p">,</span>                     <span class="p">&amp;</span>
                                            <span class="n">independent</span>
    <span class="kt">REAL</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="k">DIMENSION</span><span class="p">(:),</span> <span class="k">ALLOCATABLE</span>  <span class="kd">::</span>  <span class="n">differentiate</span>
    <span class="c">! Local variables</span>
    <span class="c">! ...</span>

    <span class="c">! Perform the calculation</span>
    <span class="c">! ...</span>
    <span class="k">RETURN</span>
<span class="k">END FUNCTION </span><span class="n">differentiate</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We see that this function is called <code>differentiate</code> and takes two arguments:
<code>independent</code> and <code>dependent</code>. While programs are ended with the keyword
<code>STOP</code>, functions (and subroutines) are ended with the keyword <code>RETURN</code>.
We call the function with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">field</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">data_size</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">differentiate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">postn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">data_size</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">potntl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">data_size</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>(1:data_size)</code> is an example of “array-slice notation.” More on that later.</p>
<p>Unlike languages based on C, arguments are not declared in the argument list
but in the body of the procedure alongside the local variables. You also need
to declare the return variable, which, by default, has the same name as the
function. When
declaring the arguments you should add the attribute <code>INTENT(&lt;value&gt;)</code> where
<code>&lt;value&gt;</code> may be <code>IN</code>, <code>OUT</code>, or <code>INOUT</code>. The first instructs the
compiler that the value of the argument must not be changed within the
procedure, while the second tells the compiler that the variable <em>must</em> have a
new value assigned to it within the procedure. The initial value of this
argument in the procedure is not guaranteed to be the same as the one it held
prior to being passed. The final option basically tells
the compiler that there are no such requirements for that argument and is the
default case if you omit the <code>INTENT</code> attribute. No <code>INTENT</code> should be
given to the return variable, although it is treated as if it were declared
with <code>INTENT(OUT)</code>.</p>
<p>Something which you may have noticed here is how we declared our input arrays
with <code>DIMENSION(:)</code>. This syntax can be used for procedure arguments to
indicate that the size of the array is not known in advance. The size will be
set to be however large the array passed to the procedure is. A similar
notation is used for our return value, but that’s because it is an
<code>ALLOCATABLE</code> array. More on that in the sidebar below.</p>
<p>The full code for this function is provided below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">FUNCTION </span><span class="n">differentiate</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">independent</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dependent</span> <span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>
<p>I should mention that Fortran comes with a number of built-in functions. In
particular, it has all of the mathematical functions that you’d expect. We
also so the <code>MIN()</code> and <code>SIZE()</code> intrinsic functions. The first returns
the smallest value in a list of arguments or in an array. The second returns
the number of elements in an array.</p>
<p><strong>Sidebar:</strong> You may notice that our return-variable here is declared with
the attribute <code>ALLOCATABLE</code>. By default, Fortran arrays are static, meaning
that they have a fixed length determined at compile-time. However, sometimes
you might not know what size you want at compile-time or you might want to
adjust the size part way through your program. (Here it is the former.)
In that case, you use
an allocatable array. When first declared, these arrays have no determined size,
although you do have to specify their rank by using colons in the <code>DIMENSION</code>
attribute. For example, a 3D array would be declared with <code>DIMENSION(:,:,:)</code>.
Once you know they size you want, you allocate them as follows</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">ALLOCATE</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lower</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">upper</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>where <code>lower</code> is the index which you want the array to start at while
<code>upper</code> is the index that you want it to end at. These bounds are inclusive.
Once you are done with the array, you can deallocate it with
<code>DEALLOCATE(array)</code>. You can then reallocate
it again (potentially to a different size) if you wish. When a procedure
exits, all local allocatable arrays are automatically deallocated.</p>
<p><strong>Sidebar 2:</strong> Another new feature which I’ve introduced here is the <code>FORALL</code>
construct. This structure is used for array assignment and manipulation. It
behaves similarly to a loop, but there are some important
differences. From the old array, it will calculate values for the new array
and place them in temporary storage. Once it has calculated the value for every
element it will place them in the new array. The forall construct may iterate
over the array in any order. Its main purpose is to
make it easier for the compiler to optimize your code and run it on parallel
architectures, but it is also just a convenient way of writing certain
expressions. You can learn more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran_95_language_features#The_FORALL_Statement_and_Construct">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Subroutines</h4>

<p><a name="array"></a></p>
<h3>Array Syntax</h3>
<p>Fortran features powerful array syntax, similar to what is available in
Python. The simplest bit of this syntax is if you want an array which,
element by element, is the sum of two other arrays of the same size. You
simply use the syntax
<code>array1 = array2 + array3</code>. You can use similar syntax for just about any 
operation on an array, including single-argument operators and operators with
scalars:
<code>array1 = array2 + scalar</code>. In this case <code>scalar</code> will be treated as though
it were an array of the same size as <code>array1</code> and <code>array2</code> where every
element had the same value as <code>scalar</code>. With the right keywords, you can even
apply your own functions and subroutines to arrays in this way.</p>
<p>More advanced results can be achieved using array-slice notation. This allows
you to work with only a portion of an array. The syntax is
<code>array([lower]:[upper][:stride])</code>. This returns an array containing every
<code>stride</code><sup>th</sup> element of <code>array</code> starting at <code>lower</code> and ending at <code>upper</code>. 
By default <code>increment</code> is 1,
<code>lower</code> is index at which <code>array</code> starts, and <code>upper</code> is the index at
which <code>array</code> ends. Thus, <code>array(:)</code>
corresponds to the whole array.
The slice syntax can be used in multidimensional arrays too,
with any mix you please of array-slices and specific indices in the different
directions. For example, if we had a 3D array with 100 elements in each
dimension we could specify <code>array3d(:,1:25,50)</code> would give you the a 2D array
with dimensions 100 by 25.</p>
<p>I used array slices a few times in our program. One example is when the program
calculates the electric field:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">field</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">data_size</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">differentiate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">postn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">data_size</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">potntl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">data_size</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">field</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">data_size</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">1.0</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">field</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">data_size</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The first line here calculates the derivative of the data in the arrays
<code>postn</code> and <code>potntl</code> up to the <code>data_size</code><sup>th</sup> element, storing
the results in <code>field</code>. The second line multiplies the elements of <code>field</code>
containing useful data by -1. These were very simple uses of array-slices and
shows only some of their power.</p>
<p><a name="compiling"></a></p>
<h3>Compiling and Running Your Program</h3>
<p>We now have a working program. As a reminder, you can
<a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/attachments/fortran/potential_field.f90">download it here</a>.
It’s time to compile it and see if it works! The Fortran compiler which you
will use most often is <code>gfortran</code>. This is a decent compiler<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> and has the
advantage of being free software.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> If you are running Linux then you can
install it using <code>sudo apt-get install gfortran</code> (assuming it’s
Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, or one of their derivatives—I don’t know how to use other
distro’s package managers). Otherwise you can
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries">download it here</a>.</p>
<p>Compiling and running a simple program like this is very easy; just type
<code>gfortran ./potential_field.f90</code> at the command line in the directory where
you’ve kept your source code. This will produce the executable file called
<code>a.out</code>. To run the program, type <code>./a.out</code>. Before running it, make
sure that you have a file containing your data on the electrical potential
called “in.dat”. If you use the <a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/attachments/fortran/in.dat">in.dat</a>
file provided here then you should get the following output:</p>
<p><img alt="What you should see in your terminal when you run with the input data provided here." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/fortran/output.png" style="float:none;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/></p>
<p>The output file <code>out.dat</code> should match <a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/attachments/fortran/out.dat">this one</a>.
You should see an
electric field that rounds to 20 <span class="caps">NC</span><sup>-1</sup> everywhere. Don’t worry if
your numbers vary from mine in the last few decimal places.
The last decimal places of floating point values often vary from computer to
computer and from compiler to compiler because of the finite levels of
precision with which floating point numbers can be stored.</p>
<p>If your input data is contained in some file other than <code>in.dat</code> then you
can run the
program using the command <code>./a.out infile</code>. If you want your output
data to go to a file other than <code>out.dat</code> then run the program with the
command <code>./a.out infile outfile</code>.</p>
<p>You could also compile your program with the command
<code>gfortran -o potential_field potential_field.f90</code>. This will produce an
executable called <code>potential_field</code>. Had a different argument been placed
after the <code>-o</code> flag then that would have been the name of the executable.
The program would now be run using the command <code>./potential_field</code>. Once
again, you can optionally extra arguments specifying the input and output files.</p>
<p><a name="packaging"></a></p>
<h3>Packaging Your Procedures</h3>
<p>For a small, simple program like this it is easiest to keep everything in one
file. However, as your program becomes larger, it will become desirable to
put certain things into separate files. This prevents files from becoming
overwhelmingly huge.<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> It also means that if you want to reuse some of your
procedures in other programs, it will be a lot easier to transfer them over.
If you compile them correctly (not something we’ll get into here) then you
won’t even need to transfer them—you can use the same “library” file for
multiple programs.</p>
<p>In order to retain the compiler’s ability to know whether we are passing the
correct arguments to a procedure we need to place that procedures in a “module”.
Modules are a bit like programs, containing both variables and
procedures (also “derived types,” in case you ever want to use them). However,
unlike programs, they can not be run on their own; they just contain code to
be used by other modules and programs. The basic syntax for our module is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">MODULE </span><span class="n">tools</span>
    <span class="k">IMPLICIT NONE</span>

    <span class="c">!Variable declarations</span>
    <span class="c">! ...</span>

<span class="k">CONTAINS</span>
    <span class="c">! Procedures</span>
    <span class="c">! ...</span>

<span class="k">END MODULE </span><span class="n">tools</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If your module does not contain any procedures then omit the <code>CONTAINS</code>
statement.</p>
<p>To make a module’s contents available to a program (or another module) you
place a <code>USE</code> statement followed by the module name at the very start of your
program—before even the
<code>IMPLICIT NONE</code> statement. In our case this means that our program starts with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">PROGRAM </span><span class="n">potential_field</span>
    <span class="k">USE </span><span class="n">tools</span>
    <span class="k">IMPLICIT NONE</span>
    <span class="c">! ...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If you need to load multiple modules then you place additional <code>USE</code>
statements at the start of the program, each on its own line. Take a look at
the <a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/attachments/fortran/tools_mod.f90">module</a> and
<a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/attachments/fortran/potential_field2.f90">modified program</a> to
see what changes were made.</p>
<p>The main disadvantage of using modules (although it’s one that can be
overcome with sufficient
organization and/or appropriate software tools) is that it
makes the compile process more
complicated. It is important that module files are compiled <em>before</em> any
files which use them. This is because, upon compiling the module into an
“object file,” the compiler will produce a file ending in the extension
<code>.mod</code>. This file contains information for the compiler about the contents of
the module and which will need to read as it compiles anything that
uses the module. Needless to say, if you have modules using other modules then
things can get complicated.</p>
<p>In this case we can compile like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>gfortran -c tools_mod.f90
gfortran -c potential_field2.f90
gfortran -o potential_field2 tools_mod.o potential_field2.o
</pre></div>
<p>Aside from the change in the name of the executable, the program can be run
just as before.</p>
<p><img alt="What you should see in your terminal when you compile and run our rewritten version of the program." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/fortran/output2.png" style="float:none;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/></p>

<h3>Summing Up</h3>
<p>There you have it. You’ve now seen how various features in Fortran work and
seen an example of a working program. Although this was a lot of information
all at once, Fortran really isn’t a hard language to learn. The syntax is
intuitive and the modern version comes with enough features to be useful but
not so many as be overwhelming. Don’t feel bad if you’ve forgotten some of the
syntax that I’ve gone over—even experienced programmers will occasionally have
to look something up. Hopefully now you’ll feel ready to try writing a program
of your own in Fortran and begin learning the language’s capabilities and
limitations in the best way possible: through experience.</p>

<p>For the most part we’ll be sticking to the 1995 standard. The 2003 and 2008 standards, which contain many powerful new features such as object-oriented programming, are still not entirely supported by compilers. You can see their current statuses <a href="http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Fortran+2003+status">here</a> and <a href="http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Fortran+2008+status">here</a>. That said, enough has been implemented that you can now write object-oriented code in Fortran if you are using a relatively up-to-date compiler. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>Even when working with legacy code, you can often use what’s called an interface to manually tell the compiler what arguments are required. While these are a bit tedious to write, and thus shouldn’t be used with new code, they are worth your while if you can’t package your procedures in a more modern way. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">↩</a></p>

<li id="fn:4">
<p>However, for actual computational physics, you will likely end up using <code>ifort</code> or <code>pgfortran</code>, which produce faster programs. Their major disadvantage is that the licenses are extremely expensive. They are also proprietary software. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:5">
<p>That’s free as in “free beer” and free as in “free speech”. Another way to say this is that GFortran is open source. However, some—including the <span class="caps">GNU</span> Project, which makes GFortran—object to that term and think “free software” is better. It’s one of those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9foi342LXQE">People’s Front of Judea vs. Judean People’s Front</a> sort of things. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text">↩</a></p>

<p>I know of one case where the developer refuses to split up the code, resulting in a file that is about 130 thousand lines long. It is not my favourite file to have to deal with. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text">↩</a></p>
