Labour Left
===========

These are for people who are well-established supporters of Labour's
left wing, such as members of the Campaign Group.

- Jon Trickett
- John McDonnell (likely too closely associated with Corbyn)
- Grahame Morris
- Diane Abbot (tends to be vacuous, plus not very popular)


Corbyn Supporters
=================

These are people who are either quite new and thus hadn't previously
shown left-wing commitments, or who stayed in the Shadow Cabinet after
the EU referendum.

- Imran Hussain*
- Rebecca Long-Bailey*
- Richard Burgon
- Emily Thornberry (not _especially_ left wing, but not on the right
  either and good on foreign policy)
- Cat Smith* (could easily lose seat)
- Kate Osamor*
- Angela Rayner* (a bit vacuous on education and grammar schools)
- Clive Lewis (sort of--I'm not enthusiastic after the whole
  Trident/NATO thing, plus in a potentially vulnerable seat)


Endorsed in 2015 Only
=====================

I do not list anyone who supported Owen Smith in 2016, given how
hopeless he was.

- Rushanara Ali
- Catherine West
- Tulip Siddiq (potential issues regarding the EU)


Endorsed in 2016 Only
=====================

- Stephen Hepburn (nominated Andy Burnham in 2015)
- Ian Mearns (nominated Andy Burnham in 2015)
- Andy McDonald (nominated Andy Burnham in 2015)
