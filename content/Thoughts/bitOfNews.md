Summary: As you may have noticed, there have been several blog articles released at the same time, today. The day before I went home for Christmas, the Raspberry Pi on which I host this blog refused to start and I couldn't figure out how to fix it before it was time to leave. Also, I would like to draw your attention to a new link at the top of this page entitled Software.

As you may have noticed, there have been several blog articles released at the same time,
today. If you looked carefully, you may have noticed that these have actually been written
an various days over the past couple of weeks, but have only now become available online.
I feel an explaination for this erratic behaviour is needed.

The day before I went home for Christmas, the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) 
on which I host this blog decided
that it wanted to be difficult. For whatever reason, it refused to start and I couldn't figure
out how to fix it before it was time to leave. However, Christmas break also gave me a chance
to actually write some thoughtful blog entries, which I haven't had time to do for awhile. So
I wrote away, unable to post them. Upon getting back to Halifax, the Raspberry Pi decided
that it was willing to work again, for some reason known only to itself. And thus I have been
able to post my blog entries. I apologize for the glut of writing after so long without any.

Also, while I'm writing this, I might as well draw your attention to a new link at the top
of this page entitled [Software](|filename|/pages/software.md). This takes you to a page
containing useful pieces of software which I have modified or built for myself, which you
are welcome to download. Please note, however, that some of these are only set up to work
on Linux.
