Summary: Well, I've decided to announce this blog on Facebook. Having written two serious posts, one of which was quite work-intensive, I figured that there wasn't much point in continuing if no one was going to read it. So it's time to tell the world!

Well, I've decided to announce this blog on Facebook. Having written two serious
posts, one of which was quite work-intensive, I figured that there wasn't much
point in continuing if no one was going to read it. So it's time to tell the
world!

I admit that I'm still a little bit hesitant. This blog will contain some 
rather personal information. I've already made my sexual
orientation quite clear on Facebook, but people wouldn't find out unless they
actually went looking. However, now that I've posted a link to this blog I
will essentially have come out to the world. Not that I really mind--I'm not
at all ashamed of who I am. It's just a bit of a big step. What's more, this
will essentially be me officially "coming out" as a socialist. Ironically, if
anything I find that scarier. Certainly I'm not quite ready to tell my
parents *that* yet. They were fine with my being gay, but their love and support
might only go so far... I jest. Mostly.

When I've written my previous articles it felt very much like they were going in
a diary--they were only to help organize my thoughts and no one else would ever 
read them. Now, for better or for worse, that is about to change. Or perhaps it 
won't; I guess it all depends on how interesting people find me. I hope that
everyone out there *will* find me interesting enough to at least read some of 
what I have to say. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this far! 
Happy Friday!
