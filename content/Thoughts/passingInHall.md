Title: Passing in the Hall

I'm walking past your office. Nothing unusual about that. It's on my way. I'm
holding a container of cookies that I'd made for my classmates. I'd made way
more than were necessary and wanted to see if any professors wanted
some. I'm trying to steal my nerves to knock on your door and offer you one
too. I'm thrown off-guard when I see that you're leaving your office, although
you don't have a jacket so you can't be going far. I look at you.

I want to offer you a cookie. Then maybe ask how your Christmas was. Did you
get to see your partner? I know the answer to that or, at least, I think I do;
you did, assuming I actually know who your partner is this time around. Is
there some way I can find out about all that confusion? I guess I could ask if
he's that Tony guy that Michael has mentioned. How would you respond to that,
I wonder? I mean, I know you're not together now, but I'm pretty sure you were
going into last summer. I'm pretty sure your partner is named Jackson, now.
What happened there? I guess I might be rubbing salt on some wounds. How would
you even react if this whole subject of conversation coming up? 

For that matter, how would you even react to me speaking to you? The most
communication we've had in months is you "liking" a few of my Facebook posts.
On the few occasions we've bumped into each other in the hall, neither of us
has said a word and I haven't even acknowledged your presence. I'm sorry about
that. It was unforgivably rude. I considered sending you an email apologizing
one of the times it happened, but didn't know how to explain without revealing
far too much to you. I guess I could just say that I felt awkward after asking
you out for coffee back in August. It has the benefit of being true, if
incomplete. But I'd be too embarrassed to bring that up.

Oh, but I want to. I want to say that you are probably the most amazing person
I've ever met. That I feel like we'd have a real chance together. That you're
one of the very few people with whom I've ever felt certain I'd be willing
to start a relationship with. That I want to learn everything about you. About
your childhood and your family and your time at school. About your research and
your time at university and how you're finding the city. I want to spend hours
talking about science and history and philosophy and politics. And more hours
talking about travelling and books and movies. And still more about cartoons
we've seen on the Internet and what our favourite drinks are and what we'll be
making for supper tonight. I want to talk to you about everything and nothing.

How do I explain to you what it's been like for me during these past few
months? How frustrating it's been to feel like I've met the right person, but
that he has too. That he did years ago. I've tried to meet other people, but
that's not easy at the best of times and, now, no one seems quite right. Not
next to you. I've been torn between my desire to get to know you and my desire
to avoid you as much as possible. Whenever I see you it leaves me feeling upset
and uneasy for the rest of the day. That's why I haven't allowed any real
contact between us.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry if my cold shoulder has offended. But, to be honest,
you're not the one who's really hurting here. I'm fed up with feeling this way.
Feeling the pressure of having all this bottled up in side and not being able
to tell anyone about it, least of all the person I most want to tell. I know I
won't feel this way forever, but right now it seems near enough.

I manage a smile and a nod. I hear myself say "hi," although the word barely
escapes my throat. I walk on past. I realize that I didn't even offer you a
cookie.
