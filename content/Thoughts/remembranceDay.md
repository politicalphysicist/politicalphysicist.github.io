Summary: Well, it's that time of year again. 95 years and 362 days ago we saw the Armistice that ended World War I. This marked the end of the first case technological war, which caused the world to realize the horrors that could be inflicted by industrial-scale killing. It was a horrible, pointless event in which some 16 million people lost their lives. I tend to identify as a moderate pacifist. My relative pacifism results in me having rather ambivalent feelings towards Remembrance Day. These are difficult to put into words, but I'm going to try my best here.

Well, it's that time of year again. 95 years and 362 days ago we saw the
Armistice that ended World War I. This marked the end of the first case
technological war, which caused the world to realize the horrors that could
be inflicted by industrial-scale killing. It was a horrible, pointless
event in which some 16 million people lost their lives. The world, including
the victors, reacted in horror to what they had unleashed. We quickly saw the
establishment of Remembrance Day, to commemorate the tragedy, and the red poppy
as a symbol of remembrance. Of course, as we all know, this was followed two
decades later by another, even worse, case of mass slaughter.

I tend to identify as a moderate pacifist. I'm not an absolute pacifist like
Gandhi was; I think that violence is justified if it is absolutely necessary for
self-defence. I will reluctantly admit that we probably did have to fight in
World War II, such was the threat of Hitler.[^1] But I do not believe that the
First World War was in any way necessary or justifiable. Moreover, I would argue
that the Second World War was ultimately the result of how Germany was treated
in the Treaty of Versaille and was thus, ultimately, avoidable. As for
subsequent wars in which we've been involved: I can't honestly say that I would
consider them much (if any) better than World War I.

My relative pacifism results in my having rather ambivalent feelings towards
Remembrance Day. These are difficult to put into words, but I'm going to try my
best here. While I certainly do think that we should remember the tragedy
that was the WWI, WWII, the Korean War, the Gulf War, and Afghanistan, I must
say that I have my qualms over how this is done. We are told to be grateful to
those who made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve our freedom. But to me it
feels wrong to feel grateful to people for going off to kill and be killed.
Certainly this is the case in the First World War, where I would argue that
the Allies weren't even that much more free than Germany; just look at the
treatment of
[Eugene Debs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_V._Debs#Arrest_and_imprisonment)
in the United States. But even in WWII, the most that I can say for those
who went off for war is that their actions were necessary but unfortunate and
tragic. To say that I am grateful for those actions would make it sound like I'm
celebrating them, which I emphatically do not want to do.

I have been told by one person that we should respect the fact that these soldiers
were, rightly or wrongly, willing to give up their lives for their country. But
why? We don't celebrate, in and of itself, the fact that people are willing to
give up their lives for their convictions. We only celebrate that sort of
martyrdom of we happen to agree with the convictions. We don't celebrate suicide
bombers, after all. So I'm not willing simply to celebrate that soldiers were
brave enough to go off to battle. Even if we justify their actions by saying that
they were misled, I still don't think that justifies any feelings of gratitude.
Pity, perhaps, but not gratitude. I can't even bring myself to feel respect for 
that, as doing so feels like it would be to endorse uncritical obedience.

I guess what I'm saying is that Remembrance Day asks us to celebrate the
sacrifices made by soldiers without ever questioning why those sacrifices were
made. It assumes that the wars in which we engaged were just. Worse still, it
often becomes a celebration of military history. In Canada in particular, we are
told about how the battles at Passchendaele and Vimy Ridge saw the "birth of a
nation." Well, the Canada that I would consider to be my country (if that
idealized country has ever actually existed) was not born in any battle.
It was born in the
establishment of trade unions, the development of our shared public
infrastructure, the creation of medicare, our rejection of the
war in Vietnam and later Iraq,[^2] the writing of the Charter of Rights and
Freedoms. I think that most Canadians perceive ourselves as being fairly peaceful,
nonviolent people. So why should we consider these battles to be the birth of our
nation? Why should a military event be given such an important role in our history
when the Armed Forces play such a small role in our culture?

But my bigger problem with Remembrance Day is how it relates to the wars that are
going on now. There is, of course, a "support our troops" message. Now, one could
argue that even this is objectionable, as the Armed Forces are basically salaried
killers. I'm not going to get into that here. In any case, no matter what my
objections may be to the Armed Forces, I'd still like to see the troops come home
safely. In fact, to me, the _best_ way that you can support our troops is to
demand that they come home. But "support our troops" always seems to have a strong
subtext of "support our wars." When I was in grade 9,
my school attended a "support our troops" rally rather than having our own
Remembrance Day ceremony. I think this was related to the fact that an alumnus had
recently been killed in Afghanistan. We were assured by the principal that this
was distinct from supporting our war. Seven years on, I can't remember exactly
what was said at the rally. But I do recall it being emphasized how brave and noble
the soldiers were being. And I distinctly remember feeling that I had been
duped into attending a pro-war event. That, to me, is not an appropriate way to
commemorate the ending of World War I.

It seems that, rather than being a time to mourn the horrendous loss of life that
we see in modern warfare, Remembrance Day has become a time when we are meant to
celebrate the sacrifices of soldiers, past and present. Implicit to this
celebration is the idea that their violence was justified. Consider "In Flanders
Field." I don't think that there is a single Remembrance Day ceremony, anywhere
in Canada, where that poem isn't read. But think about the last stanza:

> Take up our quarrel with the foe:  
> To you from failing hands we throw  
>    The torch; be yours to hold it high.  
>    If ye break faith with us who die   
> We shall not sleep, though poppies grow  
>         In Flanders fields.

It's asking us to continue fighting. Not to realize the folly of war and lay down
our arms, but to persist with it. What's more, it was written during World War I,
which was a pointless war between imperialist powers. Canadian soldiers _had_ no
quarrel with German soldiers and I consider them just as worthy of our
remembrance. But I don't recall that ever being mentioned at any of the numerous
Remembrance Day ceremonies that I have attended over the years.

All of these feelings are the reason why I haven't made it a point to wear a
poppy in recent years. To be clear, it's not that I specifically avoid wearing
a poppy. It's just that I haven't had one with me in Halifax and haven't made it
a point to buy one. I've been thinking for awhile that I should get my hands on a
[white poppy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_poppy). It seems that it would
more accurately convey my mixed feelings about Remembrance Day. I know that many
veterans find it offensive and I regret causing offence. However, if they find
the idea of denouncing the violence of the wars they fought in offensive, then
they are in the wrong and I would not censor myself for their sake.

I guess the point that I'm trying to make is: at 11:00AM on November the 11<sup>
th</sup> we _should_ remember everyone who has suffered in war. But I do mean
everyone. We should remember the Canadian and American and British soldiers who
fell. We should remember those who lived, but with both mental and physical injury.
We should remember the German and Austrian and Italian soldiers. And we should
remember the civilians who died as armies marched across the world and bombs
fell from the skies. We should remember how horrific war was. We should remember
why war should never be allowed to happen again. Lest we forget...



[^1]: I do, however, have a lot of respect for the pacifists within the CCF (the more radical predecessor to the NDP) who argued in parliament against our involvement in World War II. It's certainly a far cry from the NDP's support, a few years ago, for bombing Libya.

[^2]: Although both of these were only partial objections. We, unfortunately, did provide support for the Americans--we just never actually engaged in battle.
