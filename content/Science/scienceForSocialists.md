Summary: As you may know, my background is in the physical sciences. Well, I'm doing my undergrad in astrophysics, at any rate. As you may also know, my politics essentially correspond to socialism. So something I find quite upsetting is when I see these two interests coming into conflict. The thing is, many socialists are rather selective in their use of scientific evidence.

As you may know, my background is in the physical sciences. Well, I'm 
doing my undergrad in astrophysics, at any rate. As you may also 
know, my politics essentially correspond to socialism. And by socialism,
I mean the "common ownership of the means of production" type, not 
just the "let's maybe actually try funding our healthcare system 
properly" type. So 
something I find quite upsetting is when I see these two interests coming
into conflict. To be clear, I don't think that there is anything that 
science is saying which would imply that socialism is impossible or
undesirable. Rather, the problem lies with the socialists: while much
better than the lunatic fringe of conservatives who actively oppose
science and rationalism, many socialists are nonetheless rather selective
in their use of these tools.

While those on the Right will get things totally wrong with regards to
evolution and climate change (among other, smaller, things), those on the
Left have been known to say downright crazy things about nuclear power
and genetically modified organisms (among other, similar, things). The
good news is that, I hope, often when leftists get science wrong it is
more to do with ignorance/laziness than outright hostility. This means
that socialists can be set right. Or so I dare to dream. In reality, even
if any socialists read this, I imagine most of them will laugh me off as
an oddity. Nonetheless, I feel this task is important and I am probably
one of the relatively few people who actually has _any_ sort of 
qualification to actually _do_ it, in that I can speak as someone with a
decent scientific background, plenty of experience in critical thinking,
and a political orientation that allows me to relate to those who I
criticize.

So, over the next while (I'm not sure how long it will be--it depends on
how good I am at keeping up with this blog I suppose) I will be writing
blog posts about various topics which should be of some interest to
socialists, or anyone who follows politics and current events for that
matter. The first few things on my list will be:

* Nuclear Power: perhaps not the best choice to meet our energy needs, 
but not the doomsday technology so many people think it is.
* Genetically Modified Food: it has problems, but safety isn't one of 
them.
* Alternative Medicine: I really don't know how to sum this one up 
without being downright condescending.
* Climate Change: quite catastrophic enough without you making it sound
worse.
* Conspiracy Theories: a case of critical thinking rather than science
_per se_, but the process would be good for leftists to learn.
* Fracking: aren't the extra greenhouse gas emissions enough reason not 
to do it?
* Organic Food: no matter how good it makes you feel to buy it, evidence
of its benefits is scarce.

If you are a leftist and reading this list, you may have a problem with
one or more of my inclusions. Well, too bad. I suggest you wait until I
write the corresponding article and *then* judge. Or do some research
of your own in the meantime. If, however, you were offended by an 
omission, please note it in a comment below and remember that this list 
was not meant to be exhaustive. If I agree with what you're saying then
I might just write an article on it at some point.

I hope that this series of articles will prove helpful, interesting and 
educational for you. Even if you aren't expecting much, do try to 
approach them with an open mind; just not so open that your brain falls
out!
