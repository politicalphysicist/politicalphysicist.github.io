Summary: Well, I'm starting a blog.

Well, I've decided to start a blog. Having set up a 
[Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) as a webserver, I thought I'd try
setting up a blog on it. We'll see how good I am at keeping it up to date.

Originally I intended to write primarily about politics (the name of the 
blog describing where I fall politically). However, I've been going through
a bit of a slump lately, when it comes to politics. Eventually my passion
will come back, hopefully. But because of this, I'll be talking about many
things. Among them:

*   Science
*   Astronomy/Physics
*   Socialism
*   Politics
*   Environmentalism
*   Linux
*   Computer Programming
*   Being Gay
*   Asperger's Syndrome
*   Musical Theatre
*   My Life
*   My Thoughts
*   My Grumbling (which may be related to any or all of the above)

I hope that my writings will interest, challenge, amuse, educate, 
entertain, stimulate, and/or otherwise engage you. Enjoy reading!
