Title: Blog, Rebooted

Summary: After years of dragging my feet, I have finally designed a new theme for my blog, using the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) CSS package. Along with the new theme, I have updated the information on all of the static pages and moved it to GitHub pages. Perhaps most importantly, I have renamed and rebranded in order to reflect my evolving identity, both personally and politically; my blog is now called _The Political Physicist_.

For awhile now I've been meaning to create a new theme for my blog. Previously
I was using a modified version of the
[Gum theme](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/gum), but
I wanted one which was all my own. I also decided that I wanted a distinctly
different look for my blog, using serif fonts and darker colours. Years of
procrastination finally came to an end when I knew that I would need to design
such a theme for a professional website (I'll post more on that once it's
finished) and thought I might as well design a similar blog theme while I was
at it. You can find the theme
[on GitHub](https://github.com/cmacmackin/backdrop-theme).
You may also notice
that I have a new favicon (shown here at higher resolution). This is the
silhouette of one of Oxford's many "dreaming spires." For those of you who
don't know, I'll be starting my graduate studies at Oxford this fall. As I quite
like Oxford's nickname as "the city of dreaming spires," I decided that
this would be a nice symbol for my blog. Incidentally, that silhouette was
traced from the image to the right (or on the bottom, depending on your screen
size).

While I was at it, I got around to updating various pages on this website. I
have added a more detailed About page, provided an up-to-date listing of
software that I have written, and changed the Technical page to more accurately
represent how the blog now works. I have also reorganized the categories I give
articles, eliminating the two which had the fewest articles. As a note, those
articles were not deleted--simply folded into other categories. The main
motivation for this was simply to ensure that everything fit well on the
navigation bar. Next year I will be moving back into residence for grad school
and thus won't be able to run a server on which to host my blog. In preparation
for this, I decided to move it to GitHub pages. This will likely also be (at
least temporarily) the host of my professional website, once it is completed.

Most importantly, I decided to change the name of my blog from _Red Shades of
Green_. I had originally chosen that title in order to reflect that I was
concerned about the environment, but that I was a bit of a pinko. Since then,
I feel that I have become much more stridently left-wing and, at the same time,
have lost a certain amount of patience with the environmental movement and the
behaviour of ecosocialists. Not to say that I care about the environment any
less; I simply take a different approach to the issue than I used to[^1].
One which is more firmly pro-technology. And one which integrates environmental
issues into socialism, rather than the other way around. I suppose these days
a more accurate title would be _Green Shades of Red_.

Instead I went with _The Political Physicist_. At risk of explaining the
obvious, this is a play on political science. As a scientist (well, a student
scientist) who cares deeply about politics, you might say that I'm a political
scientist. However, this makes it sound like I study political science, rather
than physics. And the rest, as they say, is history.

But while the appearance, location, and name of my blog has changed, none of the
content has really. I will still write my extremely biased political articles.
I will still complain about petty things, like the use of the phrase "growing
exponentially," and I'll still write in great detail about programming and
software despite the fact that most of my audience can't understand a thing I
say about it. Even as I prepare to travel across the ocean to spend the next
three years in grad school, studying a totally different branch of physics from
what I have so far, I am still essentially the same person and that fact is
reflected here. As I enter this new chapter of my life, I invite you all to
share the adventure with me, knowing that, in all probability, at the end of it
I will be just as neurotic, pedantic, and idealistic as I am today.
