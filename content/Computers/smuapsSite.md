Summary: I have recently finished designing a new website for the Saint Mary's University Astronomy and Physics Society (SMUAPS). I decided to build this website using Pelican (the same software that I use for this blog). The website can be found [here](http://ap.smu.ca/~smuaps).

I have recently finished designing a new website for the Saint Mary's University
Astronomy and Physics Society (SMUAPS). I decided to build this website using
Pelican (the same software that I use for this blog) because of my familiarity
with it and because of the versatility of the software. The website can be found
[here](http://ap.smu.ca/~smuaps). If you would like to find
out about the technical details of how the site is designed, see these two
posts:
[README (Website Documentation)](http://ap.smu.ca/~smuaps/readme-website-documentation.html) and
[New Website Design](http://ap.smu.ca/~smuaps/new-website-design.html).
