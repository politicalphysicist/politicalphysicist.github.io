Title: About

I am a physics student, recently having graduated with an Honours degree in
Astrophysics. This fall I will begin studying for my DPhil (PhD) in Oceanic,
Atmospheric, and Planetary Physics at the University of Oxford. I will be
researching the interaction between the ocean and ice-shelves. Ice-shelves are
edges glaciers which float on top of the ocean. The fresh water from the glacier
is less dense than the salt water of the ocean, resulting in interesting fluid
dynamics as the ice shelf melts. I will be investigating what instabilities can
develop during the melting process which could lead to the disintegration of
the ice sheets.

One of my primary interests outside of physics is politics, resulting in the
title of this blog. I am
fiercely left-wing and consider myself a socialist. This means that I believe
the economy should be collectively owned and democratically controlled. That
said I'm not really a Marxist--more Marx-ish. I write
various articles expressing a socialist perspective on this blog and, in
particular, I try to bring to bear any politics insights arising from my
perspective as a scientist. A big part of my politics is protecting the
environment--hence
my chosen area of study. I believe that science and technology will make it
possible to live comfortably and sustainably, but that capitalism is unlikely
to be able to apply those technologies in the necessary ways.

My other, more mundane, major hobby is programming. I love tinkering with
computers and writing software. In addition to the software which I write as
part of my research, I often write programs in my spare time to fill a currently
unoccupied niche. I will often post my projects on this blog and much of my
code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cmacmackin). I also designed
the theme for this blog and for my professional website. I use this theme with
the [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) static site generator to produce my
websites. You are welcome to use and/or modify the theme for any of your own
projects.
