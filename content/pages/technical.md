Title: Technical

*The Political Physicist* runs on the blog engine 
[Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/). This is a piece of software,
written in [Python](http://www.python.org/), which generates static HTML blog
pages. These pages are then pushed to GitHub Pages where they are hosted.

I designed this theme using the [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
framework, customised with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). It is available
on GitHub in its [own repository](https://github.com/cmacmackin/backdrop-theme)
or as part of the [Pelican Themes](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes)
repository. Pelican
themes are written using [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/). Blog content
is written using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a 
lightweight markup language. Comments are powered by 
[Disqus](http://disqus.com/). The search features are powered by
[Tipue Search](http://www.tipue.com/search/), with modifications of the
output to better match the blog theme.
