Status: Draft

There has been much talk of crisis in the energy sector in recent
months and this topic featured prominently at the 2021 Prospect Energy
Sector Conference. In December Prospect released a report on the
failing of the energy retail market along with suggestions of how to
fix it.[^1] Below I summarise the report and then provide my own analysis.

### Report Contents

#### The Problem

The report details the massive reduction in the number of energy
retailers seen over the past year. It notes that this has eroded
public trust in energy suppliers and a levy will be added to people's
bills to cover the cost of cleaning up after failed companies. It is
stated that "Prospect believes it is time to radically rethink our
whole approach to energy retail and accept that the idea of a market
for energy is largely a fiction."

Examining the failures of the existing model more closely, the report
notes the supply sector (the sale of electricity to consumers) has
relatively low profit margins. Most of the costs (and profits) are
accrued from energy production, transmission, and due to policy costs
(e.g., green energy levies). To make money, suppliers have relied on
overcharging customers that do not switch, in order to subsidise the
promotional rates offered to new customers. Many of the newer small
suppliers have actually operated at a loss. Customers that do not
switch suppliers overpay for energy, while those that do switch
underpay. The introduction of the energy price cap eliminated the
profit in the supply sector.

The recent surge in wholesale energy prices and the time-delay before
the energy price cap is updated to reflect this placed a financial
stress on suppliers. Ofgem had not been evaluating entrants to the
market to determine whether they could withstand these sorts of
shocks, meaning that many have now collapsed. Ofgem is currently
under-resourced to enforce any such rules were they to be
introduced. The report notes

> Since its inception the retail market has swung between two
> extremes: it has either been an oligopoly of the Big Six,
> characterised by excessive profits and weak incentives to treat
> consumers well, or over-crowded and loss-making, with worsening
> outcomes for consumers and retail staff. It is not at all clear that a
> privatised, profit-seeking market structure can find a stable balance
> between these two extremes.

The report also notes the increasing cost of energy as a share of the
household bills of the poorest decile and the failure to reduce energy
poverty substantially over the past 20 years. Another problem is the
squeeze on pay for workers at energy firms which has resulted from
competition in this market. Finally, lack of success in deploying
energy saving measures and smart meters in the drive for Net Zero is
criticised.

#### Proposed Solutions

This report offers two policy measures. The first, and most dramatic,
is to place the supply of energy in "local public ownership". It is
made clear that this would be a monopoly, with a single supplier
available in each region. They believe this would increase public
confidence that a fair price is being charged and provide the
reatilers with greater stability. This would be coupled with giving
local authorities the responsibility and funding for the roll-out of
energy efficiency programs.

It is proposed that in England, groups of local authorities would own
region energy companies, while the devolved governments would own a
company for their territory. (Presumably this does not include
Northern Ireland, which is part of the Irish energy market and
governed under separate laws.) This scale would give "pricing power in
wholesale energy markets" and having fewer suppliers would make
regulatory oversight easier. It is also hoped that the long-term
contracts these suppliers could negotiate with generators would help
reduce wholesale market volatility.

The report notes the failure of recent council-owned energy suppliers
Robin Hood Energy and Bristol Energy. However, it is suggested that
these were primarily due to the way these suppliers had to behave in
the context of a competitive market and that the conditions for a
public monopoly would be fundamentally different. This experience
shows the "need to overhaul the current retail structure and create an
environment that allows providers driven by social objectives rather
than profit to thrive."

The other proposal made in this report is "social energy tariff" which
would be made available to the poorest households. This would be
funded either by government or cross-subsidisation from other people's
bills. Few details are given on how this would be implemented, but a
goal of keeping energy below 5% of household spending is suggested.

### Response

This report makes an important contribution to the debate over the
current crisis in energy costs. In particular, it rejects the notion
that the problem can be solved by more competition and savvy consumers
choices. Instead, it acknowledges that energy is an area
of life which is ill-suited for a market framework, which has tended
to result either in price-gouging by incumbents or market instability
due to newcomers selling energy below cost. Moreover, there are
important social and environmental considerations with energy which
the market can not address, requiring the sector to operate
more like a public service.

With that being said, I felt that these principles were not taken to
their logical conclusion. Many of the most deep-seated problems in the
energy sector can not be addressed by focusing solely on the _supply_
of energy. The central problems the report identifies are somewhat
limited:

- Consumers are not paying a "fair" prices for energy.
- The collapse of suppliers ultimately costs consumers money.
- Workers at the energy suppliers are being squeezed.
- The energy market has failed to reduce energy poverty.
- The private energy suppliers have contributed to failing to achieve
  Net Zero goals.

I analyse these issues in more detail below.

#### Considering the Critiques

The report does not explicitly define what constitutes a "fair" price
for energy, but it appears to be one which reflects the wholesale
costs of energy and its transmission. Unfortunately, little
consideration is given as to where those costs arise from. It is noted
that most of the profits the energy sector are accrued in generation
and network operations, but the proposals the report makes do not
directly affect these parts of the sector. One would hope that the
public suppliers could purchase electricity and cheaper bulk rates,
but this would not be a massive saving. The report also notes that
many customers (those that switch suppliers regularly) underpay for
their energy. Proposing that their costs go up will not be popular and
I suspect would make it more difficult to get support for the
implementation of these proposals--although with most people now paying
at the energy price cap, that may no longer be an issue.

For all its focus on the collapse of energy supply companies, the
report doesn't really explain why this is a problem for average
people. After all, no one's lights have gone out. The only concrete
issue they note is that bills will increase (by £94 a year, according
to Citizen's Advice) to cover the cost of dealing with this. While
that cost is certainly unwelcome, it pales in comparison to the £600
increase in the energy price cap that has been announced. To me this
seems like very much a secondary problem for the energy system.

The issue of pay for workers at energy suppliers is a more weighty one
and is something a trade union is right to raise. However, the report
often gives the impression that these are the result of energy prices
being too low. Perhaps this is true, but playing the interests of
energy workers against the interests of energy users (themselves also
workers, for the most part) seems politically unwise to me. We need to
find ways to unite these two groups as we fight for affordable, stable
energy prices.

I thought that the arguments about the failure of the competitive
market to reduce energy poverty were extremely weak. A plot in the
report shows that energy poverty rates have in fact decreased
marginally from 2003 to 2019 (although presumably will now be
rising). This is not an issue where I would expect the presence or
absence of a competitive retail market to have much bearing. The real
problem is one of wholesale costs, availability of well-payed jobs,
and other broader social factors.

The failure of various energy efficiency schemes are real and the
fragmented nature of the energy retail sector has made them much more
difficult to implement. However, I think it is somewhat misleading to
talk about this as a "failing on Net Zero". By far the most important
aspect of our transition to Net Zero emissions is changing how our
energy is _produced_, something which the supply companies have
effectively no influence over. I think that the privatised wholesale
market in energy has been a major impediment to this transition (for
reasons I have detailed elsewhere) but the report is not looking at
this and, in fact, seems to propose that it would continue in
more-or-less its current form.

#### Evaluating the Proposals

The key insight of this paper--that energy is a sector for which
competitive markets are not the suitable model--is a very significant
one.  I felt the most positive aspect of these proposals is the
endorsement of a public *monopoly* in electricity supply. This goes
further than similar policies put forward by the Labour Party in
previous elections; they proposed only local public suppliers
competing in the market (a position now seemingly abandoned--indeed,
at the 2021 Prospect Energy Sector Conference, Alan Whitehead MP
claimed the party had never endorsed any public ownership of energy
suppliers despite it being prominent in the 2017 manifesto). I thought
the explanation of why this could succeed where previous experiments
in council-owned energy companies have failed was a good one. Public
monopolies would eliminate wasteful duplication, ensure no one is
penalised for loyalty, and maximise public influence over the
generators. Such monopolies are expressly forbidden by EU energy
regulations,[^3] however, and we would need to carefully consult the
terms of the Withdrawal Agreement and EU-UK Trade and Cooperation
Agreement to determine whether such a policy would be permitted. It
might also be challenged on the basis of excluding European companies
from the British market. I do not mean to say that we should abandon
the policy but merely that we need to be prepared for any
ramifications.

I strongly agree that public energy companies have a key role to play
in improving energy efficiency. In addition to the suggestions made in
this report, these companies could revive the electrical goods
retailers which the old nationalised electricity boards ran. These
could sell or lease energy efficient products at cost, or offer
financing integrated with energy bills. They could act as customers
for British appliance producers and thus help reinvigorate
manufacturing in the UK. These energy companies could also take over
the running of electric vehicle charging points, again integrating
payment with monthly energy bills. However, we need to clarify how
exactly the authors of the report imagine this working. At one point
they note that it makes sense to offer efficiency initiatives through
energy suppliers, as that is how consumers come into contact with the
energy sector. However, elsewhere it is recommended that public supply
companies operate at a regional level while efficiency programs be
devolved to local authorities. Perhaps one way to resolve this would
be to have local authorities effectively operating a franchise of the
regional company.[^4]

That being said, I am somewhat skeptical of the proposed structure of
public ownership. A public body, such as the proposed utilities, is
most accountable to the public when it answers to a single directly-elected
assembly (be it Westminster, a devolved government, or a local
authority). This allows political parties to campaign around how a
utility should be run and easily implement those promises if
elected. If instead they have to negotiate with a number of other
owners, this direct relationship between voters and the public
utility is lost. So, while Scottish and Welsh government electricity
companies could make sense to me, I object to ownership by groups of
English local authorities. For reasons of democratic control and
accountability, I would advocate either an energy company for all of
England (accountable to Westminster) or a separate one for each local
authority.  Were we to see the creation of regional governments in
England, then they could also be viable owners.

I felt that the biggest weakness of the proposals here lay not in
anything they sought to do but in what they failed to propose. They
are looking  to reform only the supply portion of the energy sector
(arguably the least important component) while
leaving everything else as it is now. The public suppliers would
continue to purchase electricity from private producers on a
competitive wholesale market. This is unlike the old electricity
boards which purchased electricity from the publicly-owned Central
Electricity Generating Board (in England and Whales--Scotland and
Northern Ireland had different arrangements). Also unlike the
electricity boards, these public suppliers would not own the
grid. They would, in effect, operate a billing system and a computer
to place bids on the wholesale market; nothing else.

This is insufficient to deal with the real problems at the heart of
the sector. The recent surge in wholesale prices was due to a reliance
on global gas markets (and thus swings in world demand), a lack of gas
storage, and an electricity generation mix that uses too much
gas. Changing the arrangements of energy suppliers won't address any
of this and consumers would still be faced with rising bills. A system
somewhat like the one proposed has existed in the Canadian province of
Ontario since about 2000, with a competitive generating sector and
(mostly, albeit declining) public retailers. This era has seen
dramatic increases in energy prices compared to the previous
vertically-integrated public utility. As already noted, public energy
suppliers would also do little to combat profiteering in the energy
sector as a whole. This report does not make reducing energy prices a
priority, except for the very poorest. However, I do not believe
Prospect can win public support for changes to the energy sector
unless we make cheaper energy for everyone a key part of our demands,
at least over the long term.

As already noted, the most important element of reaching Net Zero emissions is
changing how we generate electricity. We'll also need
to generate a lot more of it, as various sectors are electrified. That
will require changes to other components of the energy sector than
retail. In particular, it will require large scale planning to ensure
successful integration of renewables, nuclear, and energy storage to
meet demand. This is something which a competitive energy market is
not well-suited for, as there is not guiding mind to oversee it. Private owners
are also generally loathed to make the sort of long-term investments
which will be required. Among the most successful
decarbonisation campaigns was the nuclear build-out in France during
the 1970s and 1980s, which was made possible by EDFs then-monopoly in
all aspects of the electricity sector. We should be arguing for a
similar public monopoly in this country, or to move in that
direction. At the very least, we need to do away with the liberalised
wholesale market and replace it with long-term power-supply contracts
with a national grid operator.

One might respond that this report is not ruling out changes to other
components of the electricity sector, it is just focusing on the
component which is currently in crisis. However, as I've already
shown, the extent to which the bankruptcy of energy suppliers impacts
average people is relatively minor in comparison to rising wholesale
prices. Moreover, the changes propsed here would be organisationally
difficult. Generator companies (or individual powerplants) could
straightforwardly be turned into public companies and run much as they
are now. The same applies for energy networks. However, the retail
companies are currently run on a national basis, supplying energy
throughout Great Britain. Nationalising them would be straightforward
enough, but breaking them up (or combining them) into local or
regional companies would be extremely difficult as they do not
currently have any regional basis. The alternative of creating the new
companies from scratch and then gradually transferring customers and
staff to these might work better but would still be complex and
time-consuming. If we are proposing large and disruptive changes to
the energy sector, then it would make sense to do these all at the
same time.

Finally, I'm not particularly enthralled by the idea of the "social
tariff". The real problem here is not energy poverty but just poverty
full-stop. We should be looking to make changes to the welfare state
to address that. Of secondary importance is the issue of
poorly-insulated homes (best addressed through housing policy and
energy efficiency initiatives) and high energy prices for
_everyone_. A social tariff is a program that will benefit only a few
people and therefore generate little popular support to push for its
implementation. Perhaps instead we should consider something like
covering energy network costs out of general taxation (thus paid
progressively based on income) or making initial units of energy
available at low cost but then stepping up the cost for high users.

### Alternatives

This report, like much talk about energy policy in the past several
years, has been focused mostly on the supply sector, despite
the fact that it is not the fundamental source of dysfunction. The
biggest problems in the energy sector all stem from the fact that
generation and transmission are owned by a fragmented profit-seeking
companies with short investment-horizons and no guiding-mind
responsible for the system as a whole.

As I have hinted above, I believe that we need to see the return of a
single public company responsible for energy production and
distribution in Great Britain, along the lines of the old Central
Electricity Generating Board. It could then sell to regional retail
companies, from which households would purchase energy, but given the
existing retailers are not organised on a regional basis I do not
think it would be worth the difficulty of creating such
companies. Instead we should seek to bring at least following into
public ownership:

- All renewable energy generators not on private homes
- Electricity storage facilities
- Sizewell B nuclear power plant (the only one with significant life remaining)
- All nuclear power plants currently under construction, once completed
- The electricity networks (transmission and distribution)
- The gas networks
- Remaining gas storage facilities
- All energy supply companies

It would probably make sense to bring at least some gas power plants
into public ownership as well, as they'll likely be needed for some
time yet. The above assets would be merged into a single national
company (or perhaps two companies: one for electricity, one for
gas). The wholesale market in electricity and gas would be ended,
replaced with long-term contracts between the nationalised company and
remaining private producers. The new companies would be required to
develop a multi-decade plan for meeting Net Zero targets, with new
infrastructure publicly-owned wherever possible. They would also be
required to provide adequate training for staff and to tackle issues
of workplace fatigue, both problems which have plagued the energy grid
sector. The provision of energy efficiency measures could be done in
partnership between the utility and local authorities, perhaps using a
franchise model. Ending the energy market and returning to a
vertically-integrated nationalised utility would doubtless be an
extended and complicated process. However, the experience of the
Canadian province of New Brunswick, which did just that ten years ago
(albeit from a less fragmented starting-point),
shows that it is possible.[^last]

Over time, the move away from volatile global gas markets towards
renewable and nuclear energy, the ability to borrow at public-sector
interest rates, and economies of scale can be expected to stabilise
and reduce energy costs for everyone. However, to gain public support
for such an ambitious program we will also need to offer more
immediate relief. Reduced corporate profits can help to reduce energy
prices. Given that everyone has to pay a flat rate for the energy
networks, this amounts to a regressive tax and there would be a strong
argument to fund it out of general taxation instead (with fees
remaining for second homes and commercial customers). As already
mentioned, some sort of progressive tariff (with costs per unit of
energy rising with use) could also be worth considering.

### Conclusion

As the part of the energy sector which is most visible to consumers,
the energy retail companies understandably receive a disproportionate
amount of attention in discussions. However, as I hope this essay has
demonstrated, they are really the least important component of the
sector and the real issues lie elsewhere. While Prospect's proposals
would be an improvement on the status quo and the support for public
monopoly is a significant step forward, if we take them to their
logical conclusion we can see that to address the pathology at the
heart of a privatised energy system will require more far-reaching
change.
