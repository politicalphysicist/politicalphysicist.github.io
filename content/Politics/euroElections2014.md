Summary: For those of you who weren't aware, there are currently elections going on for the European Parliament. What is interesting about this election, in particular, is that the more radical parties are expected to do well. This includes the socialist parties to the left of social democracy. In this post, in addition to some general comments on the European Parliament, I discuss the policies of these parties and my thoughts on their future.

For those of you who weren't aware (and, frankly, I suspect that will be all of
you), there are currently elections going on for the European Parliament. This
is, in principle, the legislative body of the European Union, although in
practice it is debatable how much power it actually holds. For this reason,
European elections don't usually attract too much attention, even in Europe,
and tend to have turnouts similar to those in municipal elections.

However, as an international observer, what *is* quite interesting about
the European Parliament (EP) is the shear diversity of parties represented in
it. Compared to the recent Nova Scotian election, where there was so much
homogeneity that you would be
hard-pressed to tell which party anyone belonged to, the EP elections overwhelm
you with choice. But, before I go into what the various choices are, I'll just
provide a bit of background on how the EP works.

Every country is given a certain number of seats in the EP, distributed
according to population.[^1] Exactly how Members of the European Parliament
(MEPs) are elected is left up to the individual countries, the only
requirement being that some form of
[proportional representation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation)
is used. In each country, the various national parties will put forward
candidates, some of whom will be elected. Most of the national parties will
also hold an affiliation to a European party. Elected MEPs sit in groups with
their national party, which in turn sits in a group with similar parties from
other countries, roughly along the lines of the various European parties.
Because these groups consist of a collection of national parties, they won't
necessarily have a single, coherent position--a national party will often vote
differently from its group. Additionally, the Europarties play little roll
outside of the EP; national parties campaign individually on their own set
of policies. Of
course, this all seems unnecessarily complicated and confusing, but there you
are. As best as I can tell, the reason for this complexity is that the EU
never really arose out of a plan but was more stitched together bit by bit.

The groups within the EP are (with the main Europarty composing them given
in parentheses, if more than one):

- __European People's Party__: Pro-EU (support tighter integration),
conservative. Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats are notable members.
- __Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats__: Pro-Europe, social
democracy (centre-left). While consisting of the Party of European Socialists,
in reality
they are not that different from the European People's Party when it comes to
economics.
- __Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group__: Pro-EU, centrist,
socially liberal, free-market economics.
- __The Greens--European Free Alliance__ (European Green Party): Green politics,
and representatives of nations without states (ex: Scotland, Wales, Catalonia).
Economically progressive in principle, but been known to give in to
conservatism.
- __European Conservatives and Reformists__ (Movement for European Reform):
Conservative, anti-EU. The British Conservatives are part of this party, but not
many other members.
- __European United Left--Nordic Green Left__ (Party of the European Left):
Socialists and communists. Supportive of European integration but don't like
the current setup of the EU. 
- __Europe of Freedom and Democracy__ (Movement for a Europe of Liberties and
Democracy): Anti-EU, highly conservative, right-wing populist. Tend to be very
anti-immigrant and, in particular, anti-Muslim. Similarities to the Tea Party.
- __Independents__

This list is given in descending order of the size of the EP groups. What is
interesting about this election, in particular, is that the more radical parties
are expected to do well; the European Left and Europe of Freedom
and Democracy are both hoping to make gains.
The latter has proven especially good at
tapping into discontent and anti-politics sentiment, often presenting themselves
as a real alternative to the now indistinguishable main-stream parties. I
suppose this is, strictly speaking, true as the main-stream parties tend to be
pro-EU and in agreement over centre-right economics. However, it is disingenuous
in the extreme for them to portray themselves as representing ordinary people;
for example, one of the most notable constituent national parties, the United
Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), is led by wealthy financier and
arch-[Thatcherite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage)
[Nigel Farage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage). Yet, since he drinks,
smokes, and is more plain-speaking than leaders of the larger parties, he
somehow comes off as a man of the people. This has, at times, bizarre results.
For example, a
[poll showed](http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/11/04/nationalise-energy-and-rail-companies-say-public/)
that an overwhelming majority of UKIP voters support
renationalization of rail and energy companies. The only party whose voters
supported these policies in higher numbers was Labour (unsurprising, given its
socialist origins). Yet UKIP has a radical "small government" policy, more
extreme even than the Conservatives'.[^1.5] All in all, it seems
that it is social policy that UKIP and  Europe of Freedom and Democracy attract
people with. Sad to say, many working class people with progressive economics
are distinctly xenophobic.


Far more encouraging is the growth of the European United Left--Nordic Green
Left (EUL/NGL). The national parties in this group are, to a greater or lesser
degree,
socialists. They are all vehemently opposed to [neoliberalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism),[^2] and most are (at least officially) opposed to
capitalism itself. Policies vary from stronger regulation and increased public
spending, to (re)nationalisation of banks and energy companies
(which seems to be
the standard position of group members), to outright revolutionary (although not
necessarily insurrectionary[^3]) socialism. Additionally, they call for making
the structures of the EU much more democratic. As you might have gathered, the
EU is a rather ungainly institution. There are three governing bodies, only one
of which (the EP) is directly elected. EUL/NGL supports giving more power to the
EP in order to help remedy this. In addition, the European Central Bank (ECB, in
charge of the Euro's monetary policy) is not under any sort of democratic
control. This, in particular, is something that EUL/NGL wishes to change, with
the EP appointing the Banks governors and setting its mandate (as is done with
most central banks, including the Bank of Canada). They have good reason for
this, as the ECB's current policies have exacerbated the crises in Italy,
Greece, *et al.* ("the periphery"). It is resolving these crises that
makes up the centrepiece of
EUL/NGL policies. The intention is to implement an industrial and redistributive
policy which will eliminate the imbalances between "the centre" (Germany,
France, etc.) and the periphery. While these proposals are really social
democratic, rather than anti-capitalist, they would nonetheless be of great
help and would likely make it easier for national governments to implement more radical policy.

However, there is some debate over how committed to European integration the
Left should be. Some feel that, because neoliberalism has more or less been
written into the very structure of the EU, the Left should be Eurosceptical.
However, as described above, the general position is that the Left should
reform the EU. There appear to be two main reasons to pursue this policy. One
is an objection to nationalism, which caused so much carnage in the first half
of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. It was to prevent something like this from ever
happening again that European integration was originally begun. The second
reason is that it is felt you would need to be coming to power on a continental
scale if you seriously want to confront, let alone do away with, capitalism.
Otherwise any country attempting the transition to socialism would end up
isolated as capitalist nations began committing economic warfare (as happened
to Chile in the late '60s).

Both of the above arguments are strong. However, the issues arises of what will
happen if a Left government comes to power in one country much sooner than the
others. This is not just idle speculation, as there is a very good chance that
EUL/NGL member [SYRIZA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriza) will come to
power in Greece in their next election.[^4] SYRIZA has campaigned around ending
the austerity in Greece, which is causing massive damage to their economy and
creating a humanitarian crisis. However, doing so would involve renegotiating
bailout terms with the EU. But, SYRIZA is also determined to stay in the EU
and to keep Greece on the Euro. It is unclear that the EU would allow them to
do both of these things. Undoubtedly, it would be difficult for Greece to leave
the Euro and it would also be extremely unpopular for them to pull out of the
EU. From my knowledge, it appears that SYRIZA will only go as far as the EU
lets them. Hopefully, this will be far enough to resolve the Greek crisis
(kicking out Greece would likely be damaging to Europe as well), but that might
not be the case. For what it's worth, my personal view is that Greece
shouldn't pull out on its own but if, in the course of implementing SYRIZA's
policies, they get kicked out then so be it.

Another interesting case study (if only because all of the debates here are in
English) is the formation of the new [Left Unity](http://leftunity.org/) party
in the UK. This party is actually fairly radical compared to some of its
Continental counterparts, calling for a much greater degree of nationalization
(although I suppose that Britain has a history of more extensive public
ownership than most countries, so perhaps that isn't surprising). The issue here
is that EU regulations would make it vary difficult for Left Unity to implement
many of its policies if elected. However, the reasons for staying in the EU
that I mentioned above are just as true for Britain as anywhere else and, as
a result, Left Unity has much the same set of policies regarding the EU. In this
case, I think the answer is much more clean-cut. The radical left in
Britain is lagging far behind the rest of Europe,[^5] so it is unlikely that
the UK would have a Left government before the EU as a whole. Therefore, they
might as well advocate staying in the EU and take the same position as the rest of the
European Left.

Yes, I think that, with the possible exception of countries like Greece, the
Left should be trying the achieve socialism at the European level. Various
think-tanks, such the [Rosa-Luxemburg Siftung](http://www.rosalux.de/english/foundation.html) (associated with the German party [Die Linke](http://en.die-linke.de/die-linke/welcome/)) and [transform!](http://transform-network.net/home.html)
(loosely associated with the [Party of the European Left](http://www.european-left.org/)) have called for the ultimate establishment of the United Socialist
States of Europe. This, I think, is an admirable goal. However, I am not
convinced that this goal can be achieved with the current European leftist
institutions. UEL/NGL and the Party of the European Left are both much too
loose as associations. To the extent that they coordinate trans-European
campaigns
at all, they tend to be centred around policies making up the least radical
common denominator of their members. For the most part, as with all of the
Europarties, active campaigning is left to the individual national members.
However, as is generally acknowledged, building socialism requires a Europe-wide
movement. That means a truly Europe-wide party.

Ultimately, I feel, to be successful, the members of the Party of the European
Left will have to give up their individual identities. They'll have to become
national chapters of a continent-wide party. And, do you know what? I'm actually
somewhat hopeful. For all the mess that the world is in and all the ways that
mess is likely to get worse, I can't help but feel that we'll pull through it.
It won't be easy, but the worthwhile things seldom are. To the extent that I
have faith in anything, I have faith that humanity is capable of being better
than it is today. I think Europe can do it--it can overcome the more
unpleasant parts of human nature and build a society based on cooperation and
solidarity. And if Europe can do it, then so can others. Maybe one day, before
I die, I'll wake up in a socialist [Cooperative Commonwealth of Canada](http://www.socialisthistory.ca/Docs/CCF/ReginaManifesto.htm).


[^1]: However, much like the distribution of MPs between provinces in Canada, smaller countries are favoured, possessing more seats per capita than larger countries.

[^1.5]: For example, UKIP wants to replace the public health-care system with vouchers for private hospitals.

[^2]: Policies of privatization, deregulation, budget cuts, decreased taxes (especially in the upper tax brackets), free trade, etc.

[^3]: Many left-wing thinkers nowadays argue that revolution doesn't necessarily mean insurrection--it might simply refer to a period of rapid, fundamental change in society.

[^4]: While the Right tends to become hysterical at this prospect, on the Left it is currently very fashionable to criticize SYRIZA for moving to the right. Personally, I'm not convinced that they've actually moved anywhere and think that any perception that they have is simply revealing what was always present in their ideology. For a good discussion of these issues, I recommend this lecture: [Syriza and the European Elections](http://socialistproject.ca/leftstreamed/ls215.php).

[^5]: The reasons for this are complicated, but they seem to include the fact that Britain lacks proportional representation and that the British Left is so notoriously fractious. It's pretty bad when the Wikipedia's [list of British political parties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_political_parties#Minor_far-left_parties) needs a whole section just for the Far-Left.
