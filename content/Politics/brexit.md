Summary: 

Well, the vote was for Brexit. I am stating this as a fact, not meaning to
place any particular mourning or celebration in it. I can't say I'm a fan of
the EU. I think it is neoliberal and unaccountable, probably
irredeemably so in both cases. But I take no joy in the outcome of
this vote. The narrative leading to Brexit was not one of building a
better future based on cooperation, without the constant calls for
greater "competitiveness". Instead, it was a narrative of
out-of-control immigration, the interfering outsiders, Britain no
longer being Great thanks to the burdens of the EU. It was not a
pleasant campaign for those of us on the Left.

Let me be clear: I am a believer in democratic
European federalism. However, I have serious doubts that the EU can
ever become such a system, given its extreme democratic deficit. At
best, I think that a set of countries, which would like need to be
lead by Leftist governments, would essentially secede from the EU at
once to form some other institution.  More likely,
any such government would be forced out of the EU if it tried to
implement a serious Leftist program, long before a coordinated
secession could be achieved. I don't think the EU will ever be
a conducive battleground for Leftist ideas.

So, this leaves us in a depressing state. The exit vote was driven by
right-wing narratives, while staying would have locked us into a neoliberal
framework. I knew this was the choice ahead of us long before the vote
occurred. We were faced only with bad outcomes. Given that, I
won't condemn anyone on the Left for their choices, whether they voted
to leave, remain, spoiled their ballot, or abstained. I knew that,
however they voted, Leftists were not motivated by racism or
nationalism but by a genuine concern for building a better world. I knew that,
regardless of the result of the vote, we were going to need to fight
harder than ever to build international solidarity, to develop
coherent policies for a socialist program, to bring the hundreds of
thousands, if not millions, of dispossessed Britons and Europeans into
the struggle for a better future.

Well, the vote was for Brexit. We have to accept that. We don't have
to like it or agree with it, but we have to accept it. Calling the
people who voted for it stupid, or racists, or saying that you're
ashamed to be British isn't going to do any good. In fact, it will
only alienate the Brexit voters--who we'll need if the Left is ever to
get elected--even more. Perhaps today was a defeat for
the Left. Well, the Left has had almost nothing but defeats in this
country (or anywhere else) since 1979, and we know how to keep on going. 
This result will make many things more difficult, but it will make
some things easier.

The Brexit vote happened. We don't yet know what the final resolution to
this story will be, but we have to do everything in our power to ensure
that our future outside of the European Union is as just and humane as
possible.
