Summary: For some time I've been curious about what's been happening with of the Left-supported social democratic government in Portugal. It struck me as the best argument against my suspicion that  a classical social democratic government are not possible within capitalism today. I recently read two reports on the experience of government there: an enthusiastic one written by a social democratic think-tank, and a more critical one from an activist with the radical left Bloco de Esquerda which is supporting the minority government there.

For some time I've been curious about what's been happening with of
the Left-supported social democratic government in Portugal. It struck
me as the best argument against my suspicion that a classical social
democratic government are not possible within capitalism today. This
was brought to the fore the other day when a Portuguese member of the
Labour Party in Oxford posted a link on the local Momentum Facebook
group to a pamphlet called
[_The Portuguese Government Solution: The "Fourth Way" to Social-Democratic Politics?_](http://www.feps-europe.eu/assets/8fe67afb-3ddd-4ccf-b35e-baa2ece549df/book-portugal-dec2017-web-pppdf.pdf). This
was produced by a European social democratic think-tank
(FEPS--Foundation for European Progressive Studies) looking at the
model provided by the Socialist Party government in Portugal and
suggesting this shows "that there is a way for these parties to
reaffirm a left-wing agenda within the EU".

The document explains how in 2015 the right wing government which had
been pursuing fierce austerity lost its overall majority in parliament
(while still remaining the largest party). The Socialist Party (PS)
chose not to support them or to enter a grand coalition, instead
opting to form a minority government with the support of the radical
Bloco de Esquerda (Left Bloc) and the orthodox Communist Party of
Portugal (as well as the latter's close allies, the Greens). While
there were large areas of disagreement between these parties, they
were able to unite around policies which reversed course on austerity
while respecting EU rules. Representatives of PS say that this was
largely consistent with what they had run on in the election, except
with the implementation of some policies accelerated. They have since
celebrated the success of this government, claiming it has functioned
far more smoothly than anyone expected. The economy has started
growing again while the deficit has fallen to within EU-sanctioned
levels. The government is popular, with support for PS growing
significantly and support for the juniour partners staying relatively
stable.

I had read a fair bit about the situation in Portugal when this
government was formed in late 2015, but had not heard much
since. Nonetheless, much of what I was now reading ran counter to the
more critical line I remembered coming from members of Bloco. As such,
I read the report with a great deal of scepticism. One thing which I
noticed, in particular, was how modest most of the measures enacted by
the government were. By and large, they were simply reversing some of
the worst policies of the previous government, doing little to
actually implement new progressive measjres. Personally, I would
question whether that really amounts to a repudiation of the Third Way
and a return to social democracy's roots, as the PS claims.

I was very interested to hear Bloco's side of the story. I started by
rereading some of the
[material produced in 2015]((https://jacobinmag.com/2015/11/bloco-esquerda-portugal-silva-ps-pcp-be-austerity-merkel-troika)). These
contradcited on a number of assertions made by the FEPS report,
starting with the idea that the PS had campaigned on ending
austerity. Bloco members claimed that PS had run a
contradictory campaign and ran on policies similar to those of their
right wing opponents. As such, it was
[initially expected](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/10/left-bloc-portugal-austerity-social-democracy)
that they would support a minority right wing government. In fact, it
seems to be a running theme that Bloco was overly pessimistic about
the prospects for a left government. They didn't expect PS to be
interested in trying to build one, then they didn't expect PS to agree
to their demands, and then they assumed that fulfilling even these
modest demands would quickly require defying EU budgetary rules and
collapse the government. In all of this they have been proven wrong.

What I really wanted to learn, though, was how the situation had
progressed since then. Unfortunately, much of the international
left-wing websites are very good about reporting on developments when
something exciting like an election happen, while very bad at letting
us know what actually comes of those events. After a bit of digging I
found an
[interview with Bloco's leader](https://www.freitag.de/autoren/der-freitag/die-austeritaet-ist-eine-grosse-luege),
Catarina Martins, from sometime last year. While published in German,
Google Translate proved sufficiently advanced for me to get a good
grasp of what was said. It is clear that Martins views the
government's achievements as extremely limited. She points out that
most of what it has done has simply been to stop the implementation of
new austerity and reverse some of what had already been applied, as I
noted earlier. She does not consider Portugal to have a left
government, as action has been woefully inadequate to address the deep
problems facing the country and been unable to undo the effects of
austerity.

This was an interesting corrective, but didn't provide the deep level
of analysis I was looking for to contrast with the _The Portuguese
Government Solution_. After some rooting around on the
[Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung](https://www.rosalux.de/en/) website, I
eventually found an English-language report written by Bloco and Die
Linke activist Catarina Príncipe (whom I hold in high regard as a
leftist commentator). This report, titled
[_Anti-Austerity and the Politics of Toleration in Portugal: A way for the Radical Left to develop a transformative project?_](https://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/sonst_publikationen/Politics_of_Toleration_Portugal.pdf)
explains the government experience from Bloco's point of view; indeed,
although I am not certain of this, possibly from the perspective of
someone on the left of Bloco.

This report provides background on the pre-2015 political situation in
Portugal which complements that of FEPS. Once again, Príncipe
emphasised how Bloco had not expected a deal to be reached to support
a PS government. As such, they were on the back foot during
negotiations. Claims by the PS that they had always supported many of
policies demanded by the left parties are cast into doubt. Príncipe
suggests that many of these they were pushed by Bloco and the
Communists against great resistance from PS. While the government has
introduced some progressive measures, it was pointed out that Bloco
has not been completely successful in preventing new privatisation,
particularly of banks which were bailed out by the state at massive
cost to the public purse. Though not stated outright, other reading I
have done suggests that EU pressure contributed to those
privatisations. It is noted that the EU demanded new cuts in some
areas to offset increased social spending, while NATO insisted on an
increase in the military budget.

Príncipe also present a considerably less optimistic view of the state
of the economy in Portugal. She points out that while the revival is
partially due to citizens now having more spending power, it is also
heavily dependent on external factors such as an increase in tourism
and the low price of oil. Crucially, it is the result of unused
economic capacity being utilised once again and not of new
investment. In
[an interview](https://soundcloud.com/chapo-trap-house/episode-132-blocos-modern-life-81217)
(starts at 24:56) she says that public investment is extremely low,
with the funds instead being used for increases in current
expenditure. Likewise, there has been little investment in the private
sector. This contradicts claims made in the FEPS report, although some
of their investment figures are in terms of year-on-year percent
increases and could be hiding a very low starting point. Príncipe
feels that the lack of investment and precarious state of the
financial sector leaves Portugal's economy vulnerable. Should there be
a new downturn or crisis, she predicts that the PS and the EU will
quickly insist on the return to austerity in order to balance
budgets. Of course, she had also predicted that they would not agree
even to their current policy.

The report ends with an assessment of Bloco's strategy, as well as
some notes on the relation of the Left to the EU. While acknowledging
that Bloco had little choice but to support the PS government,
Príncipe is clearly uncomfortable with parts of the direction her
party has taken. At times this comes across quite clearly in the
above-mentioned interview. She believes the party must be reoriented
away from an overly parliamentary focus and seek to build the capacity
to fully challenge austerity and even capitalism.

There are some areas of clear contradiction between the two accounts,
particularly around the PS's electoral campaign and levels of
investment in the Portuguese economy. Not being able to read
Portuguese, I'm unable to properly assess who is correct in these
areas. Overall, however, I find Príncipe's account of the situation to
be the more convincing one. Of course, that may just be because it
agrees more with my preconceived notions.

So, what are the consequences for a Labour government trying to
implement something like the
[2017 election manifesto](https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/) in the UK?
That manifesto was, after-all, essentially just a return to mild
social democracy (although John McDonnell's
[Alternative Models of Ownership](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Alternative-Models-of-Ownership.pdf)
report starts to point in some more radical directions). In one
regard, at least, Labour will have it easier: even in the EU, the UK
retains more control of its monetary and fiscal policy than Portugal
by virtue of not being in the Euro. On the other hand, there are a
number of extra difficulties. For one, the PS has implemented this program
with Bloco and the Communists in parliament holding their feet to the
fire. Labour would have no such anti-capitalist left force keeping
them accountable. On the contrary, they would have a rump of
right-wing MPs who may well defy party discipline and vote against
even mildly progressive measures.

Labour's program would also go considerably further than what has been
done in Portugal, to include much greater increases in social spending
and some nationalisation. These measures are more likely to antagonise
capital, with the CBI
[already denouncing](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/labour-nationalisation-hard-brexit-cbi-president-paul-dreschler-a8252136.html)
the latter and claiming they would deter investment. Perhaps this is
just an empty threat (there was plenty of such rhetoric during the
formation of the PS government), but perhaps not. British capital is
very powerful, after all, and has often defeated measures which its
European counterparts accommodated themselves to. What's more, while
the PS remains very much an establishment party whose leaders are
trusted by Portuguese and European capital, the same can not be said
of the current Labour leadership. As such, capital may be particularly
unwilling to tolerate progressive measures coming from Corbyn and
McDonnell.

But most of all, we must remember how vulnerable the Portuguese
government is. If Príncipe is to be believed, the economic recovery
has been contingent on factors outside of their control. Should the
economy sour, the entire project of "turning the page on austerity"
would be at risk. Labour might find there is suddenly no room to
implement their mild social democratic program if there is a recession
in the UK.  Given the sickly state of the British economy and the
uncertainty surrounding Brexit, a recession could certainly
happen. There is no indication that the sort of soft end to austerity
practised in Portugal would be able to counteract it. On the contrary,
I'm inclined to believe that only a more radical left project which
started to look at asserting public control over investment decisions
would be able to prevent the return of austerity.

So, while the Portuguese experience may suggest a bit more room for
social democracy than I expected, I still don't think there is all
that much.
