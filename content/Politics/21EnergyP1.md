Summary: With the exception of Arthur Scargill, most on the Left agree that the days of fossil fuels must soon come to an end. But if we are to wean ourselves off of coal and other fossil fuels, what will take their place? The answer which springs to everyone’s lips is “renewable energy”. Unfortunately, getting a majority of Britain's energy from renewable sources is not attainable.

*I have written a series of four articles discussing Britain's energy
policy for the left-wing Labour-supporting website
[Left Futures](http://www.leftfutures.org/). In
[Part 1]({filename}/Politics/21EnergyP1.md) I explain the limits of
renewable energy sources. [Part 2]({filename}/Politics/21EnergyP2.md)
advocates for the role of nuclear power in an energy
transition. Various technologies which should be used and policies
which should be enacted in order to improve energy efficiency and
electrify heat and transport are discussed in
[Part 3]({filename}/Politics/21EnergyP3.md). Finally,
[Part 4]({filename}/Politics/21EnergyP4.md) proposes an ownership
framework capable of building the electricity infrastructure needed.*

With the exception of Arthur Scargill, most on the Left agree that the
days of fossil fuels must soon come to an end. Whatever nostalgia some
may have for the Miner’s Strike, we all know that it would be
environmental catastrophe to revive the coal industry. But if we are
to wean ourselves off of coal and other fossil fuels, what will take
their place?

The answer which springs to everyone’s lips is “renewable energy”.
Jeremy Corby has promised to have
[65% of electricity](http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/energy) coming
from renewable sources by 2030, with a longer term goal of 85%. There
is also a promise to phase out coal power plants by the early 2020s,
strive to keep 80% of global fossil fuel reserves in the ground, and
create 300 000 jobs in the renewable energy supply chain. All of this
chimes well with the calls for a
[Green New Deal](http://www.greennewdealgroup.org/) which have been
coming from progressives since the financial crisis of
2008.

But there are two problems. First, it’s not enough. Given that there are
some sectors (such as agriculture, steel, and concrete production) which
would be difficult or impossible to decarbonise, we must have greater
reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electricity than 65,
or even 85, percent. Ultimately, it will need to be 100% and it will
need to be achieved as quickly as possible. Second of all, even a target
of 65% renewable electricity is not achievable for Britain.

To date, the following types of renewable energy have found extensive
use: hydroelectric, wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. Of these,
hydro, geothermal, and biomass energy are able to provide stable,
base-load energy supplies. Hydro-power is the best-established of these
technologies and provides the vast majority of electricity in Norway and
parts of Canada. However, it requires specific geographical features to
be viable. As such, only a [few hundred
megawatts](http://www.british-hydro.org/UK%20Hydro%20Resource/England%20and%20Wales%20Resource%20Study%20Oct%202010.pdf)
of new hydro capacity could be built in England and Wales. Scotland has
somewhat more potential, with a [few
gigawatts](http://www.british-hydro.org/UK%20Hydro%20Resource/Scottish%20Hydro%20Resource%20Study%20Aug%202008.pdf)
of new capacity possible, but only a fraction of this would be viable in
practice. Furthermore, it is still only a few percent of the UK’s [50-60
gigawatt peak power
consumption](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129501.900-electricity-use-drops-as-uk-passes-peak-light-bulb/).
The role of geothermal energy in the UK is unclear: a renewable industry
group estimates that it could provide up to [20% of the country's
current electricity
needs](http://www.r-e-a.net/news/deep-geothermal-resource-has-potential-to-produce-up-to-20-of-uk-electricity-and-heat-for-millions)
and be used very effectively to heat homes, while others have suggested
that it is an [impractical power
source](http://www.withouthotair.com/c16/page_98.shtml) for Britain.
Either way, it still does not come close to meeting all energy needs.
Biomass power (largely consisting of burning wood-chips) is expensive
and of dubious environmental benefit. While it is claimed to be “carbon
neutral”, [this is
untrue](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2114993-europes-green-energy-policy-is-a-disaster-for-the-environment/)
on the time scales relevant to mitigating global warming. In fact, it
can release more GHGs than fossil fuels.

That leaves solar power and wind. Given the relatively high latitude
of the UK and the general cloudiness,
[solar panels are massively unfit](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/01/solar-panel-feed-in-tariff)
as an energy source in this country. Furthermore, solar and wind are
known as *intermittent* energy sources, as their output varies, often
in an unpredictable manner. This makes them considerably more
difficult to manage than conventional power plants. In an electricity
system with other energy sources that can be turned on and off,
intermittent energy sources could provide a significant minority of
the supply. However, as their share grows, you begin to run the risk
of brownouts. Thus, it becomes necessary to both build excess
generating capacity and to build storage capacity. This way, when the
sun is shining and the wind is blowing, some of the energy can be set
aside for when it’s dark and calm. Unfortunately, at present, we
[do not have technologies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914010290)
capable of economically delivering storage at the scale
needed. Stepping back to examine the how
[vast this scale is](https://bravenewclimate.com/2011/10/29/gws-sg-es/#attachment_5198),
it is questionable if sufficient technology will ever exist.

One of the standard responses to this is the suggestion of building a
Europe-wide smart-grid. While this may help even out some of the most
extreme troughs in generation, it is still insufficient. There is a
great deal of
[correlation between wind-speeds](http://euanmearns.com/wind-blowing-nowhere/)
across the continent, so that at times when the wind isn’t blowing
much in Italy, it also won’t be blowing much in Denmark, Germany, the
UK, or anywhere else on the continent. The net result is that for wind
energy to be a major component of the electricity supply, massive
amounts of more reliable generating capacity
[are also needed](https://bravenewclimate.com/2011/10/29/gws-sg-es/). The
eye-catching headline about Germany generating the majority of its
electricity from renewables on some day in July miss the point that it
fails to generate this much on most other days.

Given these problems, how have even existing levels of intermittent
renewable energy proven economical? What about all the people and
companies we hear about running completely off of renewable energy?
While it is, strictly speaking, true that such customers are paying
for all energy they consume to be produced by renewable sources, that
is not to say that the electricity they use *at a given time* was from
a renewable source. There would be times when they’re consuming
electricity generated from nuclear power or fossil fuels. It’s just
that at other times, the company they’re buying energy from is
producing more electricity than needed, which is then sold to other
consumers, reducing the need for fossil fuel power plants at that
time. This is all well and good for a consumer who wants to feel smug
about their purchasing decisions, but isn’t of much use if the goal is
powering an entire country (let alone the world) with renewables.

Furthermore, despite the starry-eyed praise often heard for Germany’s
“democratic” energy system, the truth is less than pretty. It is true
that a number of municipalities have bought back their energy grids
and that there are a number of energy co-ops. However, the vast
majority of the renewable capacity is owned by
[private companies and individuals](http://www.energiewende2015.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Factsheet-Renewables-from-Germany.pdf).
The feed-in tariffs used to incentivise investment in renewable energy
are set well above market energy prices and have led to the
[highest](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25200808) or
[second highest](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Electricity_prices_for_household_consumers,_second_half_2015_(¹)_(EUR_per_kWh)_YB16.png)
energy prices in Europe, while enriching investors and those well-off
enough to own a home on which to install solar panels. And yet, Jeremy
Corbyn
[slammed the Conservatives for cutting feed-in tariffs](http://www.solarpowerportal.co.uk/news/labour_leader_labels_fit_cuts_nonsensical_in_renewables_research_pledge).
Worse, the actual reductions in GHG emissions is
underwhelming. Assuming that Germany meets its targets
([which is dubious](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-set-miss-climate-goals-think-tank/energiewende-what-do-new-laws-mean)),
it plans for
[80% of electricity](https://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Redaktion/PDF/V/vierter-monitoring-bericht-energie-der-zukunft-englische-kurzfassung,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi2012,sprache=de,rwb=true.pdf)
to be renewable by 2050. On the other hand, France was able to move a
similar proportion of its electricity production to low-carbon sources
[in a decade](http://www.iea.org/stats/WebGraphs/FRANCE2.pdf).

All of this makes renewables insufficient if our goal is to
decarbonise our energy production. The problem becomes even worse when
considering that currently
[electricity makes up only 20%](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-consumption-in-the-uk)
of Britain’s energy usage. Even with efficiency gains, electricity
production will have to grow massively if it is to heat homes, fuel
cars, and power trains, and it does not appear that renewables are up
for the task.

Much of the appeal of renewable energy seems to come from a “small is
beautiful” approach to electricity production. Many people find the idea
of having a distributed energy system made up of individuals, small
businesses, and co-operatives to be appealing. It only goes to show how
much neoliberalism has altered the left’s thinking, that this is
considered a progressive approach. A market of many small producers has
more in common with Adam Smith than with any strain of socialist
thought. Such a policy would be insufficient to fight climate change,
not be able to provide a reliable electricity supply, and enrich a few
well-to-do owners of solar panels and wind farms at the cost of higher
electricity prices for everyone else.
