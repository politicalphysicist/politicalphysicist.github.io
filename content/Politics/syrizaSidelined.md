Summary: Just over five months ago, Greece elected a new government lead by left-wing party SYRIZA. SYRIZA comes out of a radical tradition rejecting both reformist social democracy and authoritarian communism and was swept to power on a wave of anti-austerity sentiment. Austerity refers to the massive cuts to public spending (tending to hurt particularly those on lower incomes) which Greece has endured over the past five years, along with the associated policies of deregulation, cuts to the minimum wage, an end to collective bargaining, and the privatization of anything which actually makes a profit for the government.

Just over five months ago, Greece elected a new government lead by left-wing
party SYRIZA. SYRIZA comes out of a radical tradition rejecting both
reformist social democracy and authoritarian communism and was swept to power
on a wave of anti-austerity sentiment. Austerity refers to the massive cuts to
public spending (tending to hurt particularly those on lower incomes) which
Greece has endured over the past five years, along with
the associated policies of deregulation, cuts to the minimum wage, an end to
collective bargaining, and the privatization of anything which actually makes
a profit for the government. These policies have been devastating for Greece,
resulting in a 26% contraction in GDP, ~25% unemployment, over 50% youth
unemployment, and a humanitarian disaster as people can't get access to food,
energy, shelter, or basic healthcare.[^1]

Now, it is fair to say that Greece did borrow too much money over the years
leading up to the crisis. However, I think it is also fair to say that there
is an inverse relationship between someone's culpability for the debt and the
pain which they have experienced under austerity. It is also true that the
Greek state is hopelessly corrupt. That said, of all of the parties represented
in the Hellenic Parliament, SYRIZA is probably the one with the greatest
commitment to try to tack that.

Anyway, none of this is new--it was all equally the case when SYRIZA was elected
in January. At that time, SYRIZA had pledged to end austerity while staying a
part of the Eurozone and refraining from any unilateral actions (i.e. defaulting
on the debt). Given that Greeks overwhelmingly favour staying in the Euro, it
is not surprising that SYRIZA would make such a commitment. They insisted that
they would be able to reverse austerity by:

1. Immediately implementing the
[Thessaloniki Program](http://www.syriza.gr/article/SYRIZA---THE-THESSALONIKI-PROGRAMME.html#.VYjAUnMl_VM)
which purported to provide a mild Keynseianism with the resources already
available to the Greek government.
2. Renegotiating the debt with Europe, on the basis that austerity clearly was
not leading to growth and was hurting the Eurozone as a whole. Furthermore, they
would point out that there was no way that Greece would ever be able to repay
the debt as the situations currently stands, whether they want to or not.

However, it almost immediately[^2] became clear to anyone who was watching with
a remotely level head that this would not be as easy as was claimed. The
leadership of SYRIZA are die-hard Europeans who, reportedly, believe in the
European project (European integration which, in reality, means the EU and the
Euro) at a deep emotional level. They were thus extremely reluctant to
countenance any sort of break with Europe, even without considering that public
opinion took a similar view. It would thus appear that they genuinely thought
that, if they were to sit down and explain to the EU why austerity was
wrong-headed then it would see the light. Now, I certainly would not condemn
giving this a try--after all, what have they got to loose? But I found it
incredibly hard to believe that they would go into these quixotic negotiations
without even a sketch of an alternative plan to pursue if they failed.

And yet that is what seems to be the case. In February, prompted by the
potential collapse of the Greek banking sector, Athens signed a deal with the
European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary
Fund (previously called "the Troika," since renamed "the institutions" or "the
Brussels group" for reasons of political spin) in order to ensure that the
European Central Bank would keep it afloat. However, this deal represented
a [major retreat](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/02/syriza-euro-austerity-troika/)
from their election promises, as it committed them to austerity (with vague
enough language that SYRIZA naively hoped that they could wriggle out of it)
and forbade them from passing any legislation which could, in the view of
"the institutions," endanger the Greek "recovery." The worst part of all of this
was that the SYRIZA leadership tried to portray this as a victory and proof that
it was possible to negotiate a resolution with Europe.

However, since that time, Greece has not actually seen any of the money that
they were promised from the Troika, as they must first start to implement the
structural adjustments demanded. This has left Athens with very little money
to make repayments on various loans coming due and, over the past few month,
the government has been drained of any remaining cash. With a major repayment
due to the IMF at the end of June, things were getting desperate.

In an attempt to get access to the funds that they had been promised, the Greek
government began backsliding on ever more of their promises. A call to halt
(and even reverse) privatizations gave way to pursuing "partnerships" with the
private sector to develop state assets, to partial privatization, to
privatization full-stop. Commitments to restore pensions to their previous
levels became a promise not to decrease them further. Promises to reduce sales
tax have turned into pledges not to raise it on essential items. A goal of
running balanced budgets (rather than a surplus) became a request to simply run
a smaller surplus. And any talk of a comprehensive investment plan to spur
growth has vanished. SYRIZA's insistence that there were certain red lines which
they would not cross looked ever more dubious.

And now, at the eleventh hour, SYRIZA has
[given way](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/22/greece-deal-red-lines-blur-and-bend)
on their pledges to protect pensions and not to raise sales tax. They've even
succumbed to calls for a higher budget surplus. To be honest, I'm somewhat
surprised by this; I had expected that if they were going to give in on those
issues then they would have done it before now. All I can conclude is that the
leadership really didn't know what it was doing and had persisted in the blind
belief that Europe was bluffing and would give in if they waited long enough.
But to anyone with half a brain it should have been obvious that this was a
delusion, at least after the agreement in February.

For SYRIZA's Left Platform, this has long been the case. Prominent members have
[consistently](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/greece-syriza-eurogroup-negotiations-austerity/)
[been calling](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/04/syriza-eurozone-default-exit-stathis/)

[Europe](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/06/kouvelakis-greece-europe-negotiations-debt-default/)
since February. Economist and SYRIZA MP Costas Lapavitsas has been
[urging an exit](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/lapavitsas-varoufakis-grexit-syriza/)
from the Eurozone since before the election and has
[drawn up plans](http://www.versobooks.com/books/1949-against-the-troika)
for how this could be accomplished. A growing number of people on the left
of SYRIZA's mainstream faction have also been won over to this view after having
witnessed the ever greater concessions which have been offered in order to
avoid rupture with Europe. However, none of this has affected the official
discourse of the party and, as such, the Greek public has been fed the delusion
that relief from austerity is possible within the Euro and support for some sort
of compromise--which, seeing as SYRIZA has given way on virtually all of its
initial bargaining positions while the institutions have given way on hardly any, is
impossible. The end result: Greeks remain totally unprepared for any sort of
rupture with Europe, having been scared stiff by the media and pandering
SYRIZA politicians of the consequences of doing anything which might endanger
their place in the Euro.

So, what now? Well, there are
[still questions](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2015/06/deal-with-greece-still-looks-wobbly.html)
over whether a deal will actually be reached. But if it is, SYRIZA's leaders
will still need to sell it to the rest of the party. And it is
[not at all clear](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/23/greek-crisis-bailout-deal-eurozone-crucial-optimism-rises) that this will happen. While it
may get the support of a majority of the cabinet, there is every sign that
SYRIZA's coalition partner will reject it (especially if it involves hikes
to sales tax) and I suspect that at least 20% of SYRIZA's own MPs would vote
against it. This would be enough to make SYRIZA rely on the support of
opposition parties to pass such a bill, which would be humiliating and would
damage the party's image.

Furthermore, it remains a distinct possibility that the party's central
committee will vote down accepting any such deal. A few weeks ago there was
a vote on a motion to break with Europe, which lost 75-95. That means only 11
committee members would have to swing in order for such a proposal to win now.
Given the scope of SYRIZA's retreat, such a result would seem entirely
possible. Then there is the prospect of discontent in the party grassroots.
Already the youth wing has held protests indicating that they would prefer
["chaos to capitulation"](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6a111b26-1583-11e5-8e6a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3dvfKopVr).
So a split in the SYRIZA ranks is looking increasingly likeley.

Now, onto the point which caused me to write this article: how should the
international Left respond to these developments? For months socialist across
Europe have been expressing solidarity with Greeks and the Greek government,
while upstart parties have been advertising themselves as the
[Spanish](http://podemos.info/)/[British](http://leftunity.org/)/[Turkish](https://hdpenglish.wordpress.com/)
SYRIZA. Should they continue to offer SYRIZA their
unconditional support? Should they condemn this retreat?

It's a tricky question, made all the harder by these groups' uncritical approach
to SYRIZA over the past while. Billing yourself as a party in the image of
SYRIZA will be distinctly damaging if SYRIZA is forced to retreat. I think it's
fair to say that we on the Left must continue to offer the Greek people our
solidarity. However, no such solidarity should be extended to any SYRIZA member
who is willing to implement austerity. Fair enough, they are in an incredibly
difficult situation and it is all too easy for us to criticize when we can't
even imagine being able to form a government in our home countries. But the fact
remains, if we are to be at all consistent then we must not endorse anyone who
implements austerity, whether they come from a left-wing background or not.

So what should SYRIZA do? From the comfort of my armchair in a country which
has not been ravaged by austerity and is safely on its own currency and who
won't be hurt if things go wrong, here are
my thoughts. For starters, they should get rid of their
leader, Alexis Tsipras, finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, and the inner circle
which surrounds them. This group has clearly revealed
themselves to be incapable of pushing back austerity in Greece, let alone of
laying the ground for overcoming capitalism. At the very least, Varoufakis
should be forced to resign.

Next comes the problem that SYRIZA does not have a mandate for breaking with
Europe. As I said earlier, they were elected promising to end austerity while
remaining in the Eurozone. However, nor do they have any mandate to implement
austerity as they look prepared to do. I'm not totally adverse to the concept
of pushing ahead and breaking with austerity, leaving the Euro if necessary,
mandate be damned. To be sure, such an approach has risks, but I can't help but
feel that those risks are better than the certainty of austerity-induced
misery within the Euro. 
In all probability, this will require a fresh election or a referendum in order
to justify it to the electorate. What's
more, there is a very good chance that SYRIZA would lose such an election and
it would almost certainly lose such a referendum. Well, so be it.

If the Greek people decide that they would prefer austerity over leaving the
Euro, then SYRIZA should resign. Let a party which really believes in austerity
be the one to implement it. SYRIZA would be better off in opposition, agitating
for an end to austerity even if it does mean a break with Europe. This would be
a serious setback but, unlike giving in to austerity, not a fatal one.
Let SYRIZA live to fight another day.
