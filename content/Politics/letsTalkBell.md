Summary: The good people at Bell, through their Let's Talk campaign, are once again donating money to mental health initiatives. Isn't that nice of them? Well, no, it's not, on several levels. First and foremost, if they really care about mental health then surely they can just donate the money anyway, rather than only do so if people share their Facebook posts.


Well, it's that time of year again. The good people at Bell, through their
Let's Talk campaign, are once again
donating money to mental health initiatives. All they ask in return is that
we spread the word by sharing their posts about it on Facebook. Isn't that
nice of them?

Well, no, it's not, on several levels. First and foremost, if they really care
about mental health then surely they can just donate the money anyway, rather
than only do so if people share their Facebook posts. Which let's us know that
mental health is _not_ what they really care about here. As, I suspect, with
most corporate donations, the real motivation is how it will effect their image.
Donating to charity will make them appear to be generous and good corporate
citizens, at least to those who are less cynical than me. Presumably they feel
that this will make people slightly more likely to choose them over Rogers (or
whatever other company you decide on from the myriad of--pardon me, virtually
_no_--other choices that exist in Canada).

But here Bell are exceptionally clever. In addition to the usual posturing you
get when a company donates to a good cause, this campaign is all about providing
Bell with advertising. It's built into the model, as the more people who share
Bell's post, the more money they will donate.
They say that for every time their post
is shared they will donate 5 cents to mental health initiatives. According to
one website, it costs about 25 cents to reach 1000 people on Facebook. That
means that each person sharing the Bell post would only need 201 friends in
order for this to be cheaper.[^1] This is far cheaper than advertising in
conventional media, or even most other online media. Furthermore, these shared
Bell posts will not be susceptible to adblocking software, as normal Facebook
advertising is.

So, we've established that Bell is not doing this out of the kindness of their
heart, but because of the positive impact on their brand and the advertising
which it generates. But surely we can still be happy about the positive outcome,
regardless of the motives behind it? Well, in a sense I suppose we should, as
this money is certainly better spent on mental health initiatives than on
returns to shareholders. But then again, we shouldn't. If Bell feels that it
has this money to give away, then to me that indicates that they aren't being
taxed enough. If they were then the revenue could be used by the government to
provide mental health initiative directly. Moreover, it would be under our
democratic control to decide if this is, indeed, the best way to spend it.
Maybe we'd decide that there is some other health concern which would be a
better use of the money. As it stand now, we have no choice in the matter.

You might ask why we should have a choice. After all, it's Bell's money. But
where does Bell get it's money from? Consumers, of course. So it's all of our
money really. That means that we should have a say over how it's spent.[^2]
Furthermore, as a way of collecting money to provide services, this is highly
regressive. Why should the amount that we spend on telecom determine how much
we contribute towards mental health initiatives? Shouldn't those who have more
money be contributing a greater percentage of their income? This is the
approach we take to taxation, after all. This argument, of course,
applies to all corporate charity. Given this, surely the best way to fund things
like mental health initiatives is via taxation.

So, Bell, if you want to help contribute that money to good causes, why don't
you give it to the government? They can spend it as necessary. Better yet, you
could let yourself be voluntarily nationalized, so that telecom could be
provided at cost, or even for free. Let this essential service, like those
surrounding mental health, be funded progressively.


[^1]: In fairness, that is probably rather optimistic, as there is plenty of overlap between people's groups of friends. Nonetheless, it's pretty good value.

[^2]: If you feel tempted to argue that this logic applies to any way in which a company spends its money, then I agree. That is why I'm a socialist and believe in public ownership.
