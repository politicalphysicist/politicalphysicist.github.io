Summary: Following on from the success of Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders in the UK and US, Niki Ashton has been presenting herself as the left-wing candidate in the current NDP leadership race. Recently she published a commitment to "environmental justice" which stacks up very well against Corbyn's disappointing commitments on energy and climate change.

There is now wide-spread knowledge of the Labour Party's recent left
turn under leader Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and its surprising success
in recent elections. This, coupled with the even more surprising rise
of Bernie Sanders in the United States, opens the question of whether
something similar could happen in Canada. Cue
[Niki Ashton's](http://www.nikiashton2017.ca/) candidacy in the
ongoing federal leadership race of the New Democratic Party (NDP). As a
Canadian living in Britain I've followed her campaign with great
interest to see how it stacks up against the Corbyn project.

One area where I have been distinctly disappointed in Corbyn has been
on
[energy and climate policy]({filename}/attachments/ManifestoResponse.pdf).
Rather than argue for a rationally planned, publicly owned electricity
system, he has pandered to the current "progressive" fad of an energy
market made up of many small, competing renewable energy
generators. Instead of replacing the private energy suppliers, he has
opted to merely to add a public supplier to the market. While nuclear
energy is not rejected, it is clearly seen as secondary to renewable
energy and will also remain in the private sector. I have argued in
the past why renewable energy
[will not be sufficient]({filename}/Politics/21EnergyP1.md) to power
Britain and why a [competitive energy market](21EnergyP4.md) is an
obstacle to addressing climate change.

Meanwhile, very little concrete is said by Labour about tackling
climate change. There is a commitment to have 65% clean energy by
2030, which is either an ambitious goal they have not developed policy
to meet or an extremely unambitious one stemming from a confusion of
"energy" and "electricity". In the
[election manifesto](http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/manifesto2017)
there is some vague talk of home insulation and electrifying the
railways (although the latter was not discussed in an environmental
context), but otherwise nonelectric energy use is unaddressed. A
[supplementary document](http://www.labour.org.uk/page/-/PDFs/ONLINE%209756_17%20Richer%20Britain%2C%20Richer%20Lives%20%C2%AD%20Labour%C2%B9s%20Industrial%20Strate....pdf)
mentions other technologies such as heat pumps, district heating,
carbon capture and storage, and electric vehicles but says little
about the type or scale of investments to be made in them, or how they
come together in a broader climate plan. Indeed, the need for a
comprehensive climate plan seems to be ignored, with a piecemeal
approach of disconnected commitments offered instead.

In stark contrast to Corbyn, Ashton has made
[fighting climate change](http://www.nikiashton2017.ca/environmental-justice/)
a central feature of her campaign, rather than just one area to which
to direct stimulus funding. While not perfect, there is a lot about
her proposals which are very good. First and foremost, rather than
talk about tackling climate change in terms of sacrifices people will
have to make (as do many environmentalists), she does so by laying out
a positive vision of the country we want to live in. She describes how
her policies will bring better employment, housing, and
communities. She even extends this to workers in polluting industries,
sketching a framework which would see them usefully redeployed. This
is the sort of approach which will motivate people to take action.

Unlike many liberal environmentalists, such as those in the Green
Party of Canada and its provincial affiliates, Ashton recognises the
role which the public sector must play in fighting climate
change. Rather than the usual emphasis on feed-in-tariffs and
independent electricity producers, she stresses that new energy
infrastructure will be public. Like Corbyn she calls for a public
investment bank to fund projects, but she goes further and proposes an
additional crown corporation[^1] called Green Canada[^2]. This entity
would not only assist in basic research in green technology, but
commercialise and manufacture it. It would
>Accelerate pollution-fighting technology by funding open-source
>research into solutions for the climate change challenges we face and
>invest in public sector clean energy innovation. Every scenario for
>avoiding runaway climate change includes a technological breakthrough
>we donâ€™t have yet. The public sector has an important role to play
>in fostering innovation. Green Canada will partner with our public
>universities to fund and carry out basic and applied research in
>renewable energy and energy efficiency at dedicated new research
>institutes. The rewards of research breakthroughs will be shared by
>all of us: selected successful research will be the basis for new

>crown corporation will grow into a complex green technology actor,
>reinvesting funds into research, taking on strategic production tasks
>that aid in meeting climate goals and providing the federal
>government with streams of revenues for other needs.

This exactly the sort of approach needed for decarbonisation. Just as
importantly, it reintroduces the idea of public ownership not simply
to run what is unprofitable, but for the purpose of economic
development and innovation. This pledge is honestly one of the most
exciting proposals I have seen from a politician in my lifetime.

The other exciting aspect of Ashton's proposals are the Green Canada
Advisory Boards. Four such boards would be created, working in
forestry, agriculture, fishing, and energy and made up of
representatives of workers, environmental experts, different levels of
government, industry, and indigenous people. Together they would
direct the operations of Green Canada and set best practices. One
advantage of such a system is that it would give workers in polluting
industries a say over how they are to be reformed or wound down. This
would make it easier to achieve buy-in for potentially controversial
reforms. More broadly, this would begin to provide democratic control
over public industry, something which has been missing from crown
corporations in the past. While Corbyn has paid lip-service to this
goal, Ashton has done more to spell out what it could look like.

Ashton's pledges are a bit weaker when it comes to non-electric forms
of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Indeed, she currently lacks
a clear schedule for reductions, although a promise is made to convene
a group of experts for this purpose. Presumably the Green Canada
Advisory Boards for agriculture and forestry would be responsible for
addressing GHG emissions from their respective sectors and from land
use change. Home heating is explicitly mentioned as an issue which
needs to be addressed, but more details could be provided. It would
also be good if district heating schemes were developed, given that
they fit well with Ashton's emphasis on collective ownership.

Electric vehicles are mentioned with a laudable emphasis on building
charging infrastructure, particularly on federal property such as post
offices. Unfortunately, no commitment is made to electrify the
government fleet of vehicles--creating a large initial
market for them--although this may have been an oversight.
Electrifying local public transit is another important issue which she
addresses. However, her goal of phasing out the sale of internal
combustion engines by 2040 is not ambitious enough. She also does not
address transport over longer distances, particularly of freight. We
need to electrify Canada's railways and move goods off of roads and
onto trains. Ideally this would be achieved by nationalising the rail
companies and folding them into the public passenger operator, Via
Rail.

My final concern is that Ashton seems intent on powering Canada using
only renewable energy. If this can even be done[^3], it will almost certainly
require a significant build-out of new hydro dams. These are often
controversial, given that they flood large areas of land, and can lead
to conflicts with local aboriginal groups. Given Ashton's (laudable)
championing of aboriginal issues and the Left's opposition to the
Site&nbsp;C hydro damn in British Columbia, I'm not sure the will
would exist to pursue this. Hydro is also distributed very unevenly
across the country, meaning some provinces would become extremely
reliant on others for their electricity. I rather doubt this
would be well received, especially for those which would come to
depend on Quebec. Ideally, a renewable plan would see the creation of
a single national power company out of existing provincial ones, to
utilise hydro nation-wide. However, constitutionally this would
require all provinces to agree and I can't see hydro-rich ones
(particularly Quebec) doing so. Indeed, such jurisdictional issues
will make it more difficult for the federal government to pursue any
green energy policy and Ashton does not address this.

For provinces without much hydro and which want a degree of
self-sufficiency in electricity, the options are carbon capture and
storage or nuclear. Neither of these are mentioned in Ashton's
proposals, although I was very pleased to see that they are not
explicitly ruled out either. My preference would be for nuclear, as
nuclear waste will likely be easier and cheaper to store than carbon
dioxide. Canada also has existing expertise in nuclear energy on which
to build, with over half of Ontario's electricity coming from this
source. To this end, I would like to see Ashton commit to
renationalise [CANDU Energy](http://www.snclavalin.com/en/nuclear)[^4]
and fold it into Green Canada.

These criticisms aside, Ashton has laid out a very good initial
blueprint for fighting climate change. While more detail is needed on
some issues, this is only a policy proposal for party leadership and
it can be expected to undergo further development before a general
election. Despite this, in some areas it is already better developed
than the policies which the Labour Party ran on. Furthermore, unlike
Corbyn's proposals, there are no fundamental problems with what Ashton
has put forward; any changes which I want to see made only involve
tweaking or expanding upon the framework already developed.  I
sincerely hope that these proposals will gain broad attention within
Canada and beyond. In particular, socialists and environmentalists in
the UK would do well to take notice.

bodies, I must say is a horrible awkward name.

[^3]: Unlike Britain, Canada has enough land that we can definitely
capture enough renewable energy to meet our needs. The problem is that
it
[remains unclear](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/4/7/15159034/100-renewable-energy-studies)
if _any_ country can provide a continuous, reliable electricity supply
using only renewable sources without massive hydro and geothermal
capacity.
