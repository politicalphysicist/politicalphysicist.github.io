Summary: As described in the previous article, renewable energy will not be able to provide the backbone of Britain’s electricity supply. If fossil fuels must be abandoned and renewable energy isn’t up for the task, that leaves nuclear power. Nuclear power is, today, almost universally reviled by the left, which views it as dirty, dangerous, and expensive. The truth is, it need be none of these things.

*I have written a series of four articles discussing Britain's energy
policy for the left-wing Labour-supporting website
[Left Futures](http://www.leftfutures.org/). In
[Part 1]({filename}/Politics/21EnergyP1.md) I explain the limits of
renewable energy sources. [Part 2]({filename}/Politics/21EnergyP2.md)
advocates for the role of nuclear power in an energy
transition. Various technologies which should be used and policies
which should be enacted in order to improve energy efficiency and
electrify heat and transport are discussed in
[Part 3]({filename}/Politics/21EnergyP3.md). Finally,
[Part 4]({filename}/Politics/21EnergyP4.md) proposes an ownership
framework capable of building the electricity infrastructure needed.*

As described in the previous article, renewable energy will not be
able to provide the backbone of Britain’s electricity
supply. Geothermal power might provide a minority of the baseload
capacity, it may be worth building new hydroelectric dams where
possible, and there is a place for some intermittent energy capacity,
but this still requires a substantial portion of the supply to come
from another source. If fossil fuels must be abandoned[^1] and
renewable energy isn’t up for the task, that leaves nuclear
power. Nuclear power is, today, almost universally reviled by the left
(with the notable exception of the Communist Party of France).  It is
viewed as dirty, dangerous, and expensive. The truth is, it need be
none of these things.

Much of the fear around nuclear power comes from not understanding the
science and risks of radiation. It is notable that scientists tend
[not to be afraid of radiation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3700115)
and are
[significantly more in favour](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/)
of building nuclear power plants than the general population. The fact
of the matter is that the extra radiation experienced by people living
near a nuclear power plant is insignificant in comparison to
background radiation, as can be seen in the chart below.

The threat of accidents has also been greatly overblown. The major
accidents which are cited are Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and
Fukushima. The
[consensus among peer-reviewed studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident#Health_effects_and_epidemiology)
is that the Three Mile Island accident led to few or no deaths. The
[causes of the accident](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html)
have been thoroughly investigated and reactor design and operating
procedures have been improved as a result. Chernobyl, far and away the worst of these incidents,
[was the fault of](http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub913e_web.pdf)
a uniquely bad reactor design and a poorly executed experiment. RBMK
reactors, such as the one at Chernobyl, are known to be unstable, had
a control rod design which initially *increases* the reaction rate,
are surrounded by flammable graphite, and lack the containment
buildings seen in all other nuclear power plants. An accident like
that at Chernobyl would not be physically possible in the types of
reactors used in the West.

Fukushima is the most recent of these and has resulted in a renewed
backlash against nuclear power. It is important to remember that this
event was initiated by an a 13m-15m tsunami resulting from a magnitude
9 earthquake,
[neither of which are events which can strike Britain](http://earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/research/events/tohoku/BritishTsunami.html). Furthermore,
the private operator TEPCO
[had been](https://web.archive.org/web/20141006070548/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/world/asia/tepco-admits-failure-in-acknowledging-risks-at-nuclear-plant.html?_r=0)
[cutting corners](https://web.archive.org/web/20131005004918/http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/2012/10/12/japan-utility-admits-nuke-crisis-avoidable-says-feared-consequences-new-safety-measures/NK3yENYHgVPQZ76POvbBLL/story.html)
in terms of disaster preparedness. Clearly, strong independent
oversight is needed for nuclear power and reactors should be in public
ownership to make corner-cutting less likely. However, Fukushima is
not an indictment of nuclear energy *per se*. No one died from
radiation poisoning and any increase in cancer deaths looks
[set to be very small](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/fukushima_report_20130228/en/)
(even when using pessimistic models) and difficult to separate from
background rates. As with Chernobyl,
[mental illness](http://www.nature.com/news/fukushima-fallout-of-fear-1.12194)
is a bigger threat to the effected population.

Obviously every death is tragic, but
[no energy source is without risks](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/21/pro-nuclear-japan-fukushima).
Despite its scary reputation, nuclear power has the
[lowest or second lowest number of deaths per gigawatt-hour](http://www.withouthotair.com/c24/page_168.shtml)
of any energy source. When things go wrong, they tend to do so in a
big, scary way, which misleads people as to the threat. New reactor
designs (and, indeed, some older ones such as the
[CANDU](http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#q)) include “passive
safety” features which do not depend on human or electronic
intervention, making accidents like those at Three Mile Island,
Chernobyl, and Fukushima physically impossible.

The other big argument against nuclear power is what to do with the
waste. It is important to keep this problem in perspective. Currently,
only
[25ml of high level nuclear waste](http://www.withouthotair.com/c24/page_170.shtml)
(the stuff which needs to be stored for thousands of years) is
produced per person, per year in Britain. Even if all of the UK’s
present energy demands were met by nuclear, it would produce about a
pint of high level waste per person, per year. This is a small volume
to deal with when compared to other forms of waste. We can keep the
waste in [dry cask storage](http://www.pntl.co.uk/safety/packages/)
indefinitely as we look for longer-term solutions, so unlike GHG
emissions this is not a pressing issue. Ultimately,
[burying nuclear waste](https://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/pdf/waste_disposal_en.pdf)
deep in dry, geologically stable regions looks to be a viable
solution. Furthermore,
[Generation IV](https://www.gen-4.org/gif/jcms/c_59461/generation-iv-systems)
reactor designs promise to be able to use existing nuclear waste as
fuel and produce much lower volumes of their own waste.

There is no denying that many nuclear projects have been
expensive. New reactor designs have been known to go over-budget. On
the other hand, while results of studies examining energy costs vary
greatly
([see the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source)),
they tend to show that overall nuclear is of comparable cost to other
energy sources. In recent years it can appear that renewable energy is
cheaper, but these studies do not seem to take into account
requirements for storage and changes to the electricity grid. Nuclear
power plants have large capital costs and low operating costs, which
means that building them in the private sector requires expensive
subsidies. Nuclear-dependent France has
[middling](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Electricity_prices_for_household_consumers,_second_half_2015_(¹)_(EUR_per_kWh)_YB16.png)
to [low](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25200808) electricity
costs and demonstrates the savings which can be achieved by building
reactors through a public sector energy monopoly to a standard
design. In the future,
[small modular reactors](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/3-ways-small-modular-reactors-overcome-existing-barriers-to-nuclear/)
could potentially be mass-produced, bringing prices down
further. While no clean energy source is cheap, nuclear is likely to
be the cheapest option for countries without hydroelectric or
geothermal capacity.

While most leftists are today opposed to nuclear energy, ironically it
is only within a left-wing
[comprehensive economic plan](http://www.leftfutures.org/2017/01/a-left-economic-strategy-for-labour-putting-meat-on-the-bones/comment-page-1/)
that nuclear power can reach its full potential. The energy transition
of
[France in the 1970s and 1980s](http://www.iea.org/stats/WebGraphs/FRANCE2.pdf)
shows what can be achieved by a state intent on transforming its power
supply. For a country to prosper, it must have a clean, reliable,
abundant energy supply and renewables alone will not provide this in
Britain. If socialism is to bring prosperity, rather than a more
equitable distribution of misery, our socialism must be nuclear
powered.


[^1]: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is sometimes invoked as a way for us to continue using fossil fuels. The issue with it is how we go about ensuring that the captured CO<sub>2</sub> *stays where we put it*. Usually it is suggested that it be stored underground, but were it to leak then it would undo all of our work capturing it in the first place. In many ways this is a more concerning problem even than nuclear waste, since the latter is solid--making it much easier to contain than a gas--and needs to be stored for only a finite time.
