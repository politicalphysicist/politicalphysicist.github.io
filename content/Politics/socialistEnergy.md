Rhetorically, Labour has fully committed itself to fighting climate
change and recognises that public ownership of energy will be vital in
doing so. However, as yet they do not have a practical plan for
achieving this. As I have explained previously, Labour's policy
proposals on green energy and climate change more generally have been
[disappointingly vague and limited]({filename}labourEnergyReview.md). Unfortunately,
the party has done little better when it comes to more explicitly
political
[questions such as nationalisation](https://weownit.org.uk/blog/labour-beyond-national-grid-public-ownership). Its
proposals will not amount to anything like a restoration of the
post-war energy sector: only the grid is to be nationalised, while new
local public generators and suppliers will continue to compete in the
market against private ones. This fails to tackle the neoliberal
electricity market which Thatcher imposed on this country, greatly
limiting the public's ability to plan and exert democratic control
over energy companies. Below I will attempt to outline what a more
appropriate ownership structure could be for energy.

### The Limits of Localism

[I have written previously](https://newsocialist.org.uk/ownership-and-markets-energy/),
about how the nature of the electrical system means that a high degree
of centralisation will remain vital in this industry, even if
individual power plants become more diffuse with the adoption of
renewable sources. I gave numerous detailed arguments for this and
will not repeat them here. Suffice is to say there is no avoiding the
fact that a national authority will be required to plan load balancing
and the correct combination of investments needed to ensure the lights
stay on. The only possible alternative would be the electricity
market, which for a host of reasons is unacceptable to socialists (and
in any case, probably wouldn't work). Some have suggested that it at
least does no harm to allow people to generate some of their own
electricity, but even this isn't entirely
true. [One utility](http://www.nbpower.com/media/772015/nb-power-2017-irp-public-english.pdf)
found that the revenue lost from widespread adoption of solar panels
would be greater than the reductions in costs of operating the
electrical system, resulting in higher prices overall.

While it is true that centralised institutions can, at times, be
alienating, that doesn't _necessarily_ mean that decentralised ones
will be more resistant to privatisation. On a recent panel discussion
hosted by We Own It, Leo Murray (of [10:10](https://1010uk.org/)) argued that it would be
impossible to privatise the solar panels on the roof of your local
primary school. Given that schools have been known to
sell off their sports grounds (or have been privatised outright, in the
form of academisation), I find this unconvincing. Indeed, attempts to
privatise the NHS have often involved greater decentralisation and
fragmentation of its management, thus breaking it into pieces of a
size more digestable for the private sector.

With all of that said, energy policy will still necessarily require local
involvement. In addition to democracy and public participation being
easier at this level, it can help to overcome NIMBYism and to
coordinate more locally-based projects such as the upgrading of
housing stock. Such arguments make the idea of a local authority-owned
grids and energy suppliers attractive. While such suppliers
(purchasing from a public monopoly in generation) do allow for the
level of planning I have called for, they come with their own
issues. First and foremost, the low-voltage grid is currently
organised at the regional scale and it is unclear if it would be
practical to break it up into locally-sized units. Secondly, if such
suppliers are created with the goal of out-competing the Big Six, then
this would represent a threat to (or at least disruption of) the [jobs
of existing employees](http://docs.google.com/document/d/1UVM8kOfWfoyMWrMbb0XyUpuaQVD19NXscVjnXNnDWhI/edit).

### A Public Monopoly on Power

Thus, the model I propose would  see the creation of a nationally
owned public utility made out of

- the national grid
- the regional grids
- interconnectors to the other countries
- zero-carbon generators (except those small enough to
  receive a feed-in tariff)
- energy storage facilities
- the supply divisions of the Big Six

During a transition period, the electricity market would continue to
operate as before, despite most of the components being owned by the
same parent company. Over this time, the newly-nationalised companies
would be fully merged and made to operate as a single,
vertically-integrated enterprise. Contracts would be negotiated with
the remaining fossil fuel power-plants (or imposed by statute, should
that prove necessary) to buy any additional electricity needed to meet
demand from them. All new powerplants would be built in the public
sector and, over time, the public utility would own the vast majority
of generating capacity. If desired, it could also make contracts to
purchase power from locally-owned generators, although I would
generally advise against this as it is likely to increase costs. The national utility would be
[required to develop plans]({filename}socialistClimate.md) stretching 20 to 30 years into the future
indicating paths it can take to eliminate fossil fuels and regularly
report to parliament on its progress. Gas heating will likely need to
be phased out (more on this below), so  it doesn't make sense
to nationalise the gas infrastructure and instead we could just have
the national supplier make use of the private network and producers.

Of course, none of this provides for any localism, so I propose that
each local authority would be charged with creating what I will call a
Local Energy Service Company (LESC). The LESCs would have numerous
roles and local authorities would be encouraged to experiment. However
they would have two core purposes: providing an interface by which
local residents could interact with the national utility and
implementing energy-related projects which _are_ inherently local in
scale.

### Linking the National and the Local

In service of the first of these goals, each LESC would be required to
establish at least one storefront, preferably on the High
Street. These would be similar to the storefronts which used to be
operated by the old Area Electricity Boards, where people could pay
their bills as well as buy electrical appliances. Both of these would
also be possible at the LESC storefront. The exact relationship
between the LESC and the national utility could be something like a
franchise system. The national utility (or a subsidiary) would provide
the stock for the store and set prices, but the LESC would handle the
day-to-day management of the premises.

Such public distribution would offer people low-cost, high efficiency
appliances. The national utility could try to build a supply chain of
cooperatively-owned manufacturers, thus providing a mechanism for
broader economic planning. However, there is an even bigger advantage
to this system when it comes to the energy transition. If the
electricity grid is to handle large-scale deployment of intermittent
renewable energy sources, "smart grid" technology will be necessary to allow
demand to adjust to meet supply. In the present system, this is often
argued for in terms of consumers becoming savvier, choosing when to
use electricity based on market conditions. This becomes particularly
true with regards to the "prosumer" model, in which we all become both
producers and consumers interacting on the liberalised energy
market. In reality, I doubt many would actually find this
prospect attractive; what people really want out of their electricity
is the ability to use it without having to think too much about
it. I suspect most people would rather leave such matters to the
national utility which would be responsible for rationally planning
the system as a whole.

If the national utility begins to supply people's electrical
appliances (via the LESC stores) then it becomes relatively
straightforward to distribute smart appliances which can be controlled
by the the grid operator. The best way to achieve this would likely be
by leasing the appliances to consumers (also avoiding high up-front
costs which might otherwise make them unaffordable). Customers would
receive discounts on the lease depending on how aggressive the demand
management is (and thus how likely it is to be noticed).

Additionally, the LESC would be tasked with consulting local residents
on energy plans. This could involve identifying potential sights for
new generators (with the information passed on to the national
utility) as well as providing feedback on national proposals. While
the goal would always be to bring local communities along with
decisions made by the national utility, it remains possible that
NIMBYism would result in an insufficient number of locations for new
power plants being identified to meet demand. Should such situations
arise, it will likely be necessary for the national plan to overrule
local preferences. While the Left typically takes the side of local
communities against national priorities, it is childish to ignore the
fact that sometimes the national interest must take priority over
local objections.

### Giving the Local its Due

The above dealt with how the LESCs would relate to the national
utility. However, there are numerous areas where they could act on
their own initiative. Key to these is heat. While electricity tends to
get the most attention when discussing energy, in truth it only makes
up about 20% of
[UK energy usage](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-consumption-in-the-uk). Gas
(used for heat) is about 30% and petrol products (mostly used for
transport) make up 50%. The latter will be left to an article in its
own right.

Burning gas is a source of CO~2~, meaning we can't use it
indefinitely. Biogas (produced by fermenting food waste) presents a
green alternative but it won't provide enough to replace our current
level of gas use. It may, however, be sufficient to power gas stoves
and barbecues. Hydrogen is sometimes suggested as a
replacement. However, it is often produced by removing carbon from
natural gas. That carbon will have to be stored somewhere. In any
case, natural gas is a limited resource. Hydrogen can also be produced
cleanly from water using only electricity. Unfortunately, this wastes
a fair amount of energy and other technologies, such as heat pumps,
would use far less electricity to deliver the same amount of heat.
As previously mentioned, the LESCs could supply heat pumps through
their high-street retailers.

However, the single most cost effective way to reduce emissions from
heat is through energy efficiency. The next Labour government should
immediately update the building code so that homes are built to the
highest standards (i.e.,
[PassiveHaus technology](http://www.passivhaustrust.org.uk/)),
drastically reducing energy use. It likely won't be possible to bring
most existing housing stock up to this standard, but considerable
improvements can be made. This is another area in which LESCs can
become involved. They could offer household efficiency assessments and
work with local builders and city works departments to perform
renovations. LESCs can also partner with existing grassroot
initiatives along these lines, such as
[Carbon Co-op in Manchester](https://carbon.coop/), where they are
present. The local company should offer to finance these renovations,
although that would likely require a partnership with a larger
organisation such as the national utility, public banks, or credit
unions.

While I have tended to dismiss local ownership of energy systems,
there is a notable exception to this: district heating networks. These
consist of centralised boilers for entire neighbourhoods (typically
municipally or cooperatively owned), with hot water pipes carrying the
heat to residents' homes. Often the heat is provided via
"co-generation" (i.e., producing heat and electricity at the same
time), although
[the efficiency of this is disputed](https://www.withouthotair.com/c21/page_144.shtml).
This likely won't be viable in future as gas must be phased out and
the supposedly green alternative (biomass) has
[dubious environmental credentials at best](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/congress-says-biomass-is-carbon-neutral-but-scientists-disagree/). Waste
incineration may be able to contribute, but capacity for this is
limited. Some have suggested using small modular nuclear reactors
(with the
[city council in Helsinki actively investigating this](http://energyforhumanity.org/en/news-events/news/news/finnish-cities-investigate-potential-small-nuclear-reactors-decarbonize-district-heating/)
at behest of the local Greens, of all people) and this would be
acceptable from a climatological perspective, although needless to say
that most on the Left would not be comfortable with it.

However, district heating systems can make effective use of heat which
would otherwise be wasted. Example sources would include heat from the
underground, data centres, supermarket refrigerators, large bodies of
water, sewage, and heavy
industry. [London has been developing a "heat map"](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/environment/energy/london-heat-map)
to identify such sources and other cities should follow
suit. Industrial scale heat pumps could also be used, along with
renewable sources such as geothermal energy and solar thermal panels
(the latter perhaps coupled with a thermal storage system). The LESCs
would be ideally placed to plan, build, own, and operate these
district heating systems. They would be a natural monopoly, allowing
progressive tariffs to be set and/or subsidies to be given to
low-income users, funded by high-income consumers.

The final big user of energy is the transport sector. This is such a
massive topic that it deserves an article of its own but, once again,
the goals will be efficiency and electrification. Efficiency will
primarily take the form of getting people out of private cars and onto
public transit, bikes, or their feet. Electrification means that the
national energy utility will need to project for an increase in demand
and plan its generating capacity accordingly. Meanwhile, the LESCs
would be well placed to oversee the build-out of charging stations for
electric vehicles. This would allow local involvement in deciding
where to place them, ensuring they do not become a nuisance. Ideally,
all such charging stations would be brought into local or national
public ownership and payment integrated with people's monthly
electricity bills.

### Conclusion

Like all aspects of climate policy, governance of the energy grid must
be able to operate on both the local and national scale. In its haste
to reject "top-down" solutions, much of the Left in this country has
lost sight of the benefits which come from being able to engage in
nation-wide planning of industry. In climate policy, as in all other
policy areas, we must be able to distinguish which sectors are
well-suited for decentralised local control and which are not.
