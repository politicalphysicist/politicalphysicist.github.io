Rhetorically, Labour has fully committed itself to fighting climate
change and recognises that public ownership of energy will be vital in
doing so. However, as yet they do not have a practical plan for
achieving this. As I have explained previously, Labour's policy
proposals on green energy and climate change more generally have been
[disappointingly vague and limited]({filename}labourEnergyReview.md). Unfortunately,
the party has done little better when it comes to more explicitly
political
[questions such as nationalisation](https://weownit.org.uk/blog/labour-beyond-national-grid-public-ownership). Its
proposals will not amount to anything like a restoration of the
post-war energy sector: only the grid is to actually be taken out of
private ownership, while new
local public generators and suppliers will continue to compete in the
market against private ones. This fails to tackle the neoliberal
electricity market which Margaret Thatcher imposed on this country, greatly
limiting the public's ability to plan and exert democratic control
over energy companies. Below I will attempt to outline what a more
appropriate ownership structure could be for energy.

### The Limits of Localism

Before proposing a new ownership structure for electricity, it is
useful to understand how the sector is currently structured. Upon
privatisation, it was split into four components: generation,
transmission, distribution, and supply. _Generation_ refers to the
powerplants which produce electricity and these are owned by a wide
range of companies including the Big Six, other energy multinationals,
and small businesses. _Transmission_ is owned by National Grid, plc,
and consists of the high-voltage wires used to send electricity from
powerplants to where it is needed across the country. National Grid
also has the responsibility of "system operator", turning powerplants
on and off (via elaborate market mechanisms) to match supply and
demand. _Distribution_ is made up of the 14 low-voltage regional grids
which carry electricity from the national grid to homes and
businesses. A number of companies own these, including some of the Big
Six as well as multinational energy corporations. Finally, _supply_
refers to the retailers from whom we actually purchase our
energy. They buy electricity from the generators on a wholesale market
through a mixture of long-term contracts and spot-trading, attempting
to match the demand of their customers. The Big Six are the dominant
players in the residential supply market, although a large number of
private and a few local authority-owned alternatives have become
available in recent years.

[I have written previously](https://newsocialist.org.uk/ownership-and-markets-energy/),
about how the nature of the electrical system means that a high degree
of centralisation will remain vital in this industry, even if
individual power plants become more diffuse with the adoption of
renewable sources. I gave numerous detailed arguments for this which
there is not sufficient space to repeat here. Suffice is to say there
is no avoiding the fact that a national authority will be required to
plan load balancing and the correct combination of investments needed
to ensure the lights stay on. The only possible alternative would be
the electricity market, which for a host of reasons is unacceptable to
socialists (and in any case, probably wouldn't work). Furthermore, the
concentration of people in relatively dense urban centres means that
there is not sufficient space for energy production to be local to
them. Some have suggested that it at least does no harm to allow
people to generate some of their own electricity, but even this isn't
entirely true. While households owning, e.g., solar panels would
reduce the amount a utility needs to spend producing electricity, the
utility still needs to pay to maintain backup capacity to provides
households with electricity when the sun isn't shining.
[One public utility in Canada](http://www.nbpower.com/media/772015/nb-power-2017-irp-public-english.pdf)
claims that the revenue lost from widespread adoption of solar panels
would thus be greater than the reductions in costs of operating the
electrical system and that this would resulting in higher prices
overall. Such a possibility is something we must be aware of when
developing energy policy; what makes economic sense at the level of
the individual does not necessarily lead to optimal outcomes at the
national level.

While it is true that centralised institutions can, at times, be
alienating, that doesn't _necessarily_ mean that decentralised ones
will be more resistant to privatisation. On a recent panel discussion
hosted by We Own It, Leo Murray (of [10:10](https://1010uk.org/))
argued that it would be impossible to privatise the solar panels on
the roof of your local primary school. Given that schools have been
known to sell off their sports grounds (not to mention academisation,
which is another form of privatisation despite continued receipt of
state funding), I find this unconvincing. Indeed, attempts to
privatise the NHS have often involved greater decentralisation and
fragmentation of its management, thus breaking it into pieces of a
size more digestable for the private sector. This is a common tactic
in the process of privatisation, as can currently be seen with the
much-vaunted SNCF in France.

With all of that said, energy policy will still necessarily require local
involvement. In addition to democracy and public participation being
easier at this level, it can help to overcome NIMBYism and to
coordinate more locally-based projects such as the upgrading of
housing stock. Such arguments make the idea of a local authority-owned
grids and energy suppliers attractive. While such suppliers
(purchasing from a public monopoly in generation) do allow for the
level of planning I have called for, they come with their own
issues. First and foremost, the distribution grid is currently
organised at the regional scale and it is unclear if it would be
practical to break it up into locally-sized units. Secondly, if such
suppliers are created with the goal of out-competing the Big Six, then
this would represent a threat to (or at least disruption of) the [jobs
of existing employees](http://docs.google.com/document/d/1UVM8kOfWfoyMWrMbb0XyUpuaQVD19NXscVjnXNnDWhI/edit).

### A Public Monopoly on Power

Given the current fragmentation of the electricity structure,
returning it to public ownership can not be simplified to demands such
as nationalising the Big Six. Instead we must focus on the individual
services and pieces of infrastructure which we wish to see under
public control.  Thus, the model I propose would see the creation of a
nationally owned public utility made out of

- the national transmission grid
- the regional distribution grids
- connections to the other countries
- zero-carbon generators (except those small enough to
  receive a feed-in tariff)
- energy storage facilities
- the supply divisions of the Big Six

During a transition period, the electricity market would continue to
operate as before, despite most of the components being owned by the
same parent company. Over this time, the divisions of the national
utility would be fully merged and made to operate as a single,
vertically-integrated enterprise. Contracts would be negotiated with
the remaining fossil fuel power-plants to buy any additional
electricity needed to meet demand from them. All new powerplants would
be built in the public sector and, as fossil fuels are phased out, the
public utility would come to own the vast majority of generating
capacity. If desired, it could also make contracts to purchase power
from locally-owned generators, although I would generally advise
against this as it is likely to increase costs. The national utility
would be [required to develop plans]({filename}socialistClimate.md)
stretching 20 to 30 years into the future indicating paths it can take
to eliminate fossil fuels and regularly report to parliament on its
progress. Gas heating will likely need to be phased out (more on this
below), so it doesn't make sense to nationalise the gas infrastructure
and instead we could just have the national supplier make use of the
private network and producers.  There is some risk that the remaining
private generators and gas companies would be uncooperative faced with
their imminent extinction, failing to invest adequately in
maintenance. There is no simple answer to addressing this, but
vigilance will be required to ensure this does not happen and, if it
is found to be cheaper than bribing the private companies to
cooperate, nationalisation should remain on the table.

Of course, none of this provides for any localism, so I propose that
each local authority would be charged with creating what I will call a
Local Energy Service Company (LESC). The LESCs would have numerous
roles and local authorities would be encouraged to experiment. However
they would have two core purposes: providing an interface by which
local residents could interact with the national utility and
implementing energy-related projects which _are_ inherently local in
scale.

### Linking the National and the Local

In service of the first of these goals, each LESC would be required to
establish at least one storefront, preferably on the High
Street. These would be similar to the storefronts which used to be
operated by the old Area Electricity Boards, where people could pay
their bills as well as buy electrical appliances. Both of these would
also be possible at the LESC storefront. The exact relationship
between the LESC and the national utility could be something like a
franchise system. The national utility (or a subsidiary) would provide
the stock for the store and set prices, but the LESC would handle the
day-to-day management of the premises.

Such public distribution would sell people high efficiency appliances
at-cost. Sales could be integrated with government grants for home
energy efficiency. Another possibility is leasing appliances, helping
avoid the issue of high up-front cost. The national utility could try
to build a supply chain of cooperatively-owned manufacturers, thus
providing a mechanism for broader economic planning. However, there is
an even bigger advantage to this system when it comes to the energy
transition. If the electricity grid is to handle large-scale
deployment of intermittent renewable energy sources, "smart grid"
technology will be necessary to allow demand to adjust to meet
supply. In the present system, this is often argued for in terms of
consumers becoming savvier, choosing when to use electricity based on
market conditions. This becomes particularly true with regards to the
"prosumer" model, in which we all become both producers and consumers
interacting on the liberalised energy market. In reality, I doubt many
would actually find this prospect attractive; what people really want
out of their electricity is the ability to use it without having to
think too much about it. I suspect most people would rather leave such
matters to the national utility which would be responsible for
rationally planning the system as a whole.

If the national utility begins to supply people's electrical
appliances (via the LESC stores) then it becomes relatively
straightforward to distribute smart appliances which can be controlled
by the the grid operator. The best way to achieve this would likely be
by leasing the appliances to consumers (also avoiding high up-front
costs which might otherwise make them unaffordable). Customers would
receive discounts on the lease depending on how aggressive the demand
management is (and thus how likely it is to be noticed).

Additionally, the LESC would be tasked with consulting local residents
on energy plans. This could involve identifying potential sites for
new generators (with the information passed on to the national
utility) as well as providing feedback on national proposals. While
the goal would always be to bring local communities along with
decisions made by the national utility, it remains possible that
NIMBYism would result in an insufficient number of locations for new
power plants being identified to meet demand. Should such situations
arise, it will likely be necessary for the national plan to overrule
local preferences. While the Left typically takes the side of local
communities against national priorities, it would be naive to ignore the
fact that sometimes the national interest must take priority over
local objections.

### Giving the Local its Due

The above dealt with how the LESCs would relate to the national
utility. However, there are numerous areas where they could act on
their own initiative. Key to these is heating. While electricity tends
to get the most attention when discussing energy, in truth it only
makes up about 20% of
[UK energy usage](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-consumption-in-the-uk). Gas
(used for heat) is about 30% and petrol products (mostly used for
transport) make up 50%. The latter will be left to an article in its
own right.

Burning gas is a source of CO~2~, meaning we can't use it
indefinitely. Biogas (produced by fermenting food waste) presents a
green alternative but it won't provide enough to replace our current
level of gas use. It may, however, be sufficient to power gas stoves
and barbecues. Hydrogen is sometimes suggested as a
replacement. However, it is often produced by removing carbon from
natural gas. That carbon will have to be stored somewhere. In any
case, natural gas is a limited resource. Hydrogen can also be produced
cleanly from water using only electricity. Unfortunately, this wastes
a fair amount of energy and other technologies, such as heat pumps,
would use far less electricity to deliver the same amount of
heat. These devices are very similar to air conditioners except,
rather than moving heat from a relatively cool home to a warmer
outdoors they move heat from a cold outdoors _into_ a relatively warm
home. Because they make use of existing heat they are far more energy
efficient than conventional electric space-heaters, which must produce
all of it themselves. As previously mentioned, the LESCs could supply
heat pumps through their high-street retailers.

However, the single most cost effective way to reduce emissions from
heat is through energy efficiency. The next Labour government should
immediately update the building code so that homes are built to the
highest standards (i.e.,
[PassiveHaus technology](http://www.passivhaustrust.org.uk/)),
drastically reducing energy use. It probably won't be possible to bring
most existing housing stock up to this standard, but considerable
improvements can be made. This is another area in which LESCs can
become involved. They could offer household efficiency assessments and
work with local builders and city works departments to perform
renovations. LESCs can also partner with existing grassroot
initiatives along these lines, such as
[Carbon Co-op in Manchester](https://carbon.coop/), where they are
present. The local company should offer to finance these renovations,
although that would likely require a partnership with a larger
organisation such as the national utility, public banks, or credit
unions.

While I have tended to dismiss local ownership of energy systems,
there is a notable exception to this: district heating networks. These
consist of centralised boilers for entire neighbourhoods (typically
municipally or cooperatively owned), with hot water pipes carrying the
heat to residents' homes. Often the heat is provided via
"co-generation" (i.e., producing heat and electricity at the same
time), although
[the efficiency of this is disputed](https://www.withouthotair.com/c21/page_144.shtml).
This probably will be less viable in future as gas must be phased out
and the supposedly green alternative (biomass) has
[dubious environmental credentials at best](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/congress-says-biomass-is-carbon-neutral-but-scientists-disagree/). Waste
incineration will be able to contribute, although will not be enough
on its own. Some have suggested using small modular nuclear reactors
(with the
[city council in Helsinki actively investigating this](http://energyforhumanity.org/en/news-events/news/news/finnish-cities-investigate-potential-small-nuclear-reactors-decarbonize-district-heating/)
at behest of the local Greens, of all people) and this would be
acceptable from a climatological perspective, although needless to say
that most on the Left would not be comfortable with it.

However, other sources are available to district heating
networks. They can make effective use of heat which would otherwise be
wasted, such as that from heavy industry, the Underground, data
centres, cooling systems, large bodies of water, sewage, and heavy
industry. One European study suggested that such heat sources
[could provide about 20%](https://vbn.aau.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/77342092/Heat_Roadmap_Europe_Pre_Study_II_May_2013.pdf)
of the EU's total heating demand by 2050. [London has been developing a "heat map"](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/environment/energy/london-heat-map)
to identify such sources and other cities should follow
suit. Renewable sources such as geothermal energy and solar thermal
panels can also be used, with the potential to store heat from the latter in the
ground or water-filled tanks during the summer, for extraction
come winter. The LESCs would be ideally placed to plan, build, own, and
operate these district heating systems where heat sources are
available and population density makes them viable. They would be a natural
monopoly, allowing progressive tariffs to be set and/or subsidies to
be given to low-income users, funded by high-income consumers.

The final big user of energy is the transport sector. This is such a
massive topic that it deserves an article of its own but, once again,
the goals will be efficiency and electrification. Efficiency will
primarily take the form of getting people out of private cars and onto
public transit, bikes, or their feet. This will be a massive,
multi-decade project involving the redesigning of our
cities. Electrification means that the national energy utility will
need to project for an increase in demand and plan its generating
capacity accordingly. Meanwhile, the LESCs would be well placed to
oversee the build-out of charging stations for electric vehicles. This
would allow local involvement in deciding where to place them,
ensuring they do not become a nuisance. Ideally, all such charging
stations would be brought into local or national public ownership and
payment integrated with people's monthly electricity bills.

### Conclusion

Like all aspects of climate policy, governance of the energy grid must
be able to operate on both the local and national scale. In its haste
to reject "top-down" solutions, much of the Left in this country has
lost sight of the benefits which come from being able to engage in
nation-wide planning of industry. In climate policy, as in all other
policy areas, we must be able to distinguish which sectors are
well-suited for decentralised local control and which are not.
