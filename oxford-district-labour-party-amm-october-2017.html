<a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2017-10-13-amm/ec-minutes-14sep2017.docx">minutes for the last <span class="caps">EC</span> meeting</a>.</p>
<h2>Oxfordshire county Labour group report</h2>
<p>Noted massive cuts to council funding. Makes things very
difficult. However, noted one major success of reversing an
outsourcing contract (with company called Carillion). Working to get
home care, school meals, etc. back in house.</p>
<p>Trying to open up the cabinet system in the county. Even non-cabinet
Tories fed up and can’t get information. Managed to get a motion
passed to conduct a review, although was watered down somewhat.</p>
<p>Noted that merging adult social care and health care is missing the
point that quality has suffered due to cuts. For most part these are
different systems so integration pointless. In any case, majority of
people needing social care aren’t eligible for it through the council.</p>
<p>Have also added system for investigating and addressing elder
abuse. Safeguarding children and children social care becoming a big,
expensive problem. While built new children’s homes to bring back
people who had to be sent out of county. However, that hasn’t happened
because so many new children entering care—often because parents
can’t afford to feed them. Universal Credit will likely make this worse.</p>
<p>Noted in case of closed Children Centres that cuts were made there
because they are non-statutory and the money was needed for
(statutory) children’s social care. Austerity makes it very difficult
to fund statutory requirements and everything else is cut to the bone.</p>
<p>In responses to questions became clear how shortages of housing,
fragmentation of schools, homelessness, crisis in social care are all
related and feed into each other.</p>
<p>The unitary authority proposal seems to have stalled.</p>
<h2>Annual conference report</h2>
<p>Full written report will be provided with the minutes. Cherry gave
highlights (Lotte was stuck on a bus from Manchester). Was very
positive about the experience, felt was in-tune with everyone for the
first time. Notes how well-organised Women’s Conference was and how
good the speakers were.</p>
<p>Reminded us that there <em>was</em> discussion of Brexit. She got the
impression that, should talks breakdown and there be a Labour
government then might see it reversed.</p>
<p>For the most part this was a review of what she told us at the
Momentum meeting. For example, she told the story of how the the
compositing process tried to neuter the <span class="caps">NHS</span> motion.</p>
<p>Felt that conference is too much to have just one delegate. In future
we should consider sending more. This will be discussed at an
executive meeting next week.</p>
<p><a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/Politics/Meetings/2017-10-13-amm/nec-conf2017-annblack.docx">Ann Black circulated a report</a>
giving a behind-the-scenes view. Notes there were way more <span class="caps">CLP</span>
delegates than usual.</p>
<p>Cherry was called out on not voting to debate the Brexit motions. She
said while she wants it reversed (and thinks it will be) she didn’t
want to tie the <span class="caps">PLP</span>’s hands at this point—unlike things like
the <span class="caps">NHS</span> where she does. Ann noted that there was a vote on the <span class="caps">NEC</span>
statement of party policy on Brexit and a failed attempt to refer back
part of the <span class="caps">NPF</span> International report. She also noted that the Brexit
motions were varied and contradictory. Cherry added that there wasn’t
a clear vision to vote for on the Brexit motion.</p>
<p>The chair said the executive will look to have an <span class="caps">AMM</span> discussing Brexit.</p>
<h2>Oxford city council report</h2>
<p>Co-deputy council leader spoke about a range of issues. Council chief
executive given a 3 year contract, despite continued uncertainty over
local government. Previously just had a 6 month contract. Westgate due
to open on October 24th. Investment going ahead on East Oxford
Community Centre. Zero-emissions zone mentioned (although John Tanner
knows more), which will be a way to help bring down currently-illegal
levels of air pollution. More information on council website.</p>
<p>Spoke about Universal Credit and how disappointed that it will
continue. Delays can cause major hardship in terms of paying rent,
buying food, etc. Have concerns about the government’s advanced
payment system because there is such a quick clawback. City decided to
set up a small fund to help people in dire need. This is needed
because county council was the first in the country to get rid of
their hardship fund. Trying to communicate with landlords to prevent
evictions. Also engaging in a publicity campaign to help claimants
understand the system.</p>
<p>Other deputy leader (not an official post, just something Oxford is
doing) also spoke. Noted that rules now require at least one women in
the three leadership positions. Reported finances are stable and
shouldn’t be any major cuts in services in next few years. Council
taxes will continue to increase at rate allowed without
referendum. Continue benefits for low income people who can’t afford
tax. Capital funding still strong and engaging commercial development
to help pay for services.</p>
<p>Pay deal with unions will expire in a few years which leaves question
mark. More risks have also been shifted onto local authorities. Have
created own building company as way to get around limits for borrowing
for council housing. Have been selling services for past few years to
bring in money, but have been pushing up against legal limits set by
central government. Setting up council-owned company to allow further
expansion of this. Continuing to press central government on housing
benefits. Council will not evict its own tenants and has been trying
to prepare them for changes.</p>
<p>Legal restrictions make it difficult to help homeless (especially if
not citizens). Trying to build another hostel and have other housing
options. Commitment to no cuts to homeless services (unlike county
council, which has cut it almost entirely).</p>
<p>Council threatening to strip Aung San Suu Kyi of freedom of city if
doesn’t step up around ethnic cleansing. Motion pointing out
importance of single market access to city. Motion on improving
cycling safety. Think I might have missed one because spoke very quickly.</p>
<p>I asked about zero emission zone and what can be done in shorter term
to improve air quality. Noted delivery lorries use those roads a lot
and this will help. I’m pretty sure that requirement won’t go into
force until 2035. Waffled about how changes need to be phased in to
allow people/companies to adjust. No time for me to respond.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="caps">BMW</span> pension dispute</h2>
<p>Motion to prevent companies dismissing and rehiring workers to
“resolve” a strike (referred to as “termination and
re-engagement”). As we were running over and this is an important
issue we will discuss it next month when there is more time. Will be a
union speaker next month, so will fit in well with that.</p>
<h2>Parliamentary report</h2>
<p>Handed out copy of detailed report. Didn’t speak very long so time for
questions. Says her constituency role is getting harder. Lots of
issues around immigration system, housing, and universal
credit. Contact with Home Office has gotten even worse. Access to the
hotline for Universal Credit only through MPs office, which places an
extra hurdle and makes it harder for advocates. <span class="caps">DWP</span> no longer sharing
info with council which will make it harder for council to offer
support. Lots of calls to stop the role-out but government haven’t
listened so far. Opposition day debate will be on this and she hopes
maybe they can get something done because situation is terrible.</p>
<p>Also talked a bit about conference. She was on compositing committee
for pay cap motion and was quite happy with how that went. Pleased
with treasury announcements, particularly around credit card debt
which she has worked on. Industry hasn’t given much pushback. Positive
about <span class="caps">PFI</span> announcement and notes that, even if expensive, not changing
it is also expensive. Same applies to tuition fees where public purse
id dealing with much lower payback rate than expected. Feels lots of
common ground in <span class="caps">LP</span> over transitional period and limiting
consolidation of government power. She’s very concerned about
government policy on customs, which she works on. She feels two
proposals put forward are a mess and badly thought through (either
similar to <span class="caps">EU</span> scheme, but not, or different custom scheme for goods
destined for <span class="caps">EU</span>). Government accruing more power over severance
payment. Non-dom reform is inadequate and leaves lots of room to avoid
tax. Labour is continuing to develop its own budget plans and draw up
amendments for the upcoming budget.</p>
<p>I asked for more details on McDonnell’s “war-gaming”. Backed him on
planning for such thing. Her impression is that business thinks Labour
seems more sane than Tories. Very concerned about complacency in
government over various economic issues and we need to think about how
to deal with this.</p>
<p>Responded to various other questions. Noted in particular that we need
transparency around Brexit. Lack of transparency breads distrust and
doesn’t help anyone. Shouldn’t treat negotiations like a poker game
but as something where we have a grown-up discussion.</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>I spoke to John Tanner after the meeting. He confirmed that lorries will still be allowed in Cornmarket Street until 2035, although their times will be restricted. Other, short-term measures are being looked at for air pollution, such as shifting bus stops (although that requires county-council cooperation). I asked about whether George Street inclusion means busses to Gloucester Green will all have to be electric. He said they will, starting in 2025. This could just be hybrid-electric and using the electric motors while on George Street. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>
