            <p><em>In response to the recent publication by the Labour Party’s National
Policy Forum (<span class="caps">NPF</span>) of various policy statements, a number of us on the
Labour Left have written responses. My response on environmental,
energy, and transport policy was published on
<a href="http://www.leftfutures.org/2017/04/npf-policy-responses-environment-energy-and-transport/">Left Futures</a>. This
is the longer, original version. I have have also produced
<a href="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/attachments/PolicyStatement-Environment.pdf">another version of this report</a>
which is more suited for use amending or replacing parts of the <span class="caps">NPF</span>’s
document, taking into account comments received on my article. Thanks
you to David Pavett for his comments and suggestions.</em></p>
<p>The National Policy Forum has made the strange decision to group
culture with the
<a href="http://www.policyforum.labour.org.uk/agenda-2020/commissions/environment-energy-and-culture/npf-consultation-2017-environment-energy-and-culture?download=true">environment and energy</a>. Meanwhile,
<a href="http://www.policyforum.labour.org.uk/agenda-2020/commissions/housing-local-government-and-transport/npf-consultation-2017-housing-local-government-and-transport?download=true">transport</a>
is placed, not completely without justification, with local government
and housing. However, as transport is a major consumer of energy and a
transport policy will be essential to fighting climate change, I
decided to address it along with energy and the environment, in place
of culture.</p>
<h2>Climate Change</h2>
<p>The <span class="caps">NPF</span> document rightly identifies climate change as one of the
greatest challenges of the century. However, beyond this, it has
little to say. It refers to the Paris Agreement of 2015, but does not
acknowledge that the stated goal of keeping warming below 2°C, or
even 1.5°C,
<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28663-paris-climate-deal-is-agreed-but-is-it-really-good-enough/">is not going to be achieved</a>
with the emissions commitment which were made. Nor is the
<a href="http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/3/23/15028480/roadmap-paris-climate-goals">magnitude of the challenge</a>
of keeping temperatures below those limits recognised. It seems
inconceivable that it could be done without state-directed economic
planning on a scale previously unseen in the West during peacetime.</p>
<figure id="figref-ukghg"><img alt="ukghg::United Kingdom greenhouse gas emissions, 1990-1995. (Department of Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy, 7 February 2017)" src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/uk-ghg-emissions.png"/><figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> United Kingdom greenhouse gas emissions, 1990-1995. (Department of Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy, 7 February 2017)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <span class="caps">NPF</span> believes that “Labour has a strong record in pressing for and
tackling climate change.” While it is true, as they say, that Labour
passed the Climate Change Act in 2008, this was
<a href="https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081028/debtext/81028-0021.htm">also supported</a>
by all but three of the Tories. The actual reductions in emissions
during Labour’s time in government were not much different from what
occurred under John Major and the Coalition (see Figure <a href='#figref-ukghg'>1</a>) and
did not come close to what is necessary. A recently published climate
plan required global emissions
<a href="http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/3/23/15028480/roadmap-paris-climate-goals">to fall by half every decade</a>
until at least 2050 and a developed country like Britain will be
required to making even faster cuts than that. If it is felt that this
is unachievable, then we need to be upfront about that and begin
preparing for the negative impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>Three omissions by this policy document should be noted. The first is
its failure to mention high-potency greenhouse gases such as methane,
nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. When weighted for global warming
potential, these make up
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589825/2015_Final_Emissions_statistics.pdf">nearly 20%</a>
of <span class="caps">UK</span> emissions, with methane being the most significant. Typically,
emissions of these gases are easier to prevent than those of carbon
dioxide, so rapid action should be taken to reduce them. Secondly, no
reference is made to the use of
“<a href="http://roadtoparis.info/2015/03/30/will-negative-emissions-technology-get-us-to-2-degrees/">negative emissions</a>”
technology, which most plans for combating climate change now
require. This involves planting trees, burning them, and sequestering
the released carbon underground. Finally, the effect of land use
changes (e.g. deforestation, conversion to agriculture) is not
mentioned, although at least
<a href="http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/3/23/15028480/roadmap-paris-climate-goals">one climate plan</a>
requires net emissions from this to reach zero by 2050. Overall, it
appears that the authors of this document know little about climate
change and have vastly underestimated the magnitude of the challenge
it now represents.</p>
<p>The closest the <span class="caps">NPF</span> comes to suggesting actual policy is to commit
that “By investing £500 billion in infrastructure backed up by a
publicly owned National Investment Bank and regional banks we will
build a high-skilled, high tech, low carbon economy to help generate a
million good quality jobs.” Lacking any details of what sorts of
investments are involved, this pledge is useless. Where specific
sectors, such as energy, are mentioned, no solutions are proposed. In
the following sections, some priority sectors will be examined in
closer detail. In the following sections, some priority sectors will
be examined in closer detail and some broad policies put forward.</p>
<h2>Energy</h2>
<p>More than once, the <span class="caps">NPF</span> comments on the importance of decarbonising
energy while at the same time tackling energy bills. The obvious
tension between wanting to “curb energy bill rises” while at the same
time invest in new energy infrastructure is never acknowledged. While
it is said that the “energy market is in need of reform”, what this
reform would look like is never stated. Indeed, the very existence of
a market in energy is never questioned; despite
<a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/11/04/nationalise-energy-and-rail-companies-say-public/">widespread support</a>
for renationalisation, the most the <span class="caps">NPF</span> has to say on this issue is
calling for a “National Investment Bank to promote public investment
and community ownership across future energy solutions”.</p>
<p>Although acknowledging that “A fully costed low carbon energy platform
that includes renewables, nuclear and green gas should be developed
and publicly financed options should be considered to ensure that the
<span class="caps">UK</span> has a low carbon economy that works for consumers moving forwards”,
no effort has been taken to do this. As I have
<a href="http://www.leftfutures.org/2017/02/energy-for-the-21st-century-part-i-fossil-fuels-renewables-and-nuclear/">argued elsewhere</a>,
any realistic decarbonisation plan will need to rely heavily on
nuclear energy. Although this would be an unpopular proposition among
many on the left, we need to face up to
<a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c18/page_103.shtml">the impossibility</a>
of powering Britain solely off of her own renewables.</p>
<p>Nuclear power can be most effectively deployed by the state using a
standardised design, adding another argument for nationalisation. A
similar argument could be made about renewable power sources. As I
have
<a href="http://www.leftfutures.org/2017/02/a-21st-century-energy-policy-part-3-the-institutions-to-make-it-happen/">argued in the past</a>,
a new Power Generation Board (<span class="caps">PGB</span>) should be created out of existing
nuclear and renewable capacity and be given control over the national
grid. This would go some way to ending the absurdity which is the
market in electricity and would give the stability needed for the <span class="caps">PGB</span>
to make long-term investments</p>
<p>To eliminate fuel poverty, progressive tariffs could be used. This
would see every household given a minimum amount of electricity at low
or zero-cost, with the price per additional kilowatt-hour rising to
current levels and above depending on how much is used in a given
month. The price bands could be structured such that high-use
customers are effectively paying for the electricity of low-use
customers and this system would not be a cost to the
government. However, for this to work, all consumers would need to be
buying from the same electricity supplier. As such, supply and
distribution should also be nationalised and either folded in the <span class="caps">PGB</span>
or passed to a devolved body.</p>
<p>Little is said in the <span class="caps">NPF</span> document about non-electric energy use. As
electricity only represents
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589825/2015_Final_Emissions_statistics.pdf">29% of greenhouse-gas emissions</a>,
this is a glaring omission. “Green gas” is mentioned and this could be
introduced into the gas supply as a short-term measure to reduce
emissions from heating. Some hydrogen could also be added and, if
appliances are converted, the gas supply could be switched entirely to
hydrogen. However for new houses (and, in the mid-term, for existing
ones), better energy efficiency can achieved using electric heat
pumps. Transport will also need to be electrified and this will be
discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p>Finally, nothing is said in the document about energy efficiency. All
new homes should be built to the highest standards of insulation and,
to the extent feasible, old homes should be retrofitted along these
lines. New home designs should try to maximise daylight and heat from
the sun. Even in the <span class="caps">NPF</span> document on housing, such things are not
considered. Appliances should be subject to strict efficiency
requirements and the government could create a program to buy old,
inefficient models back from citizens.</p>
<h2>Agriculture</h2>
<p>Agriculture is included in environmental policy, although the main
focus of the <span class="caps">NPF</span> draft seems to be on the issue of subsidies
post-Brexit. I will leave this issue to someone who knows more about
agricultural economics. However, it might be worth considering whether
a system of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_management_(Canada)">supply management</a>
could replace subsidies. This would involve farmers selling to
marketing boards which they run in partnership with the state. The
marketing boards then operate a monopoly on wholesale and return any
profits to the farmers. For the overall system to be effective,
controls would be required on imports and exports of the managed
agricultural products, which may not be possible depending on the <span class="caps">UK</span>’s
relationship with the <span class="caps">EU</span>.</p>
<p>Agriculture is also a major source of greenhouse gases, making up
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589825/2015_Final_Emissions_statistics.pdf">10% of the <span class="caps">UK</span>’s total</a>. These
are mostly in the form of methane and nitrous oxide. The former is
produced in the digestive systems of livestock (particularly cattle)
while the latter comes from the use of fertilisers. While this is not
an area which I am greatly knowledgeable about, measures such as
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#agriculture">more precise application of fertiliser</a>,
better soil management, different crop rotations, new animal
feeds, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36315952">supplements to animal feeds, and breading</a>
could all play a role. Any agricultural subsidies should be made
conditional on farmers taking action to reduce their emissions.</p>
<h2>Transport</h2>
<p>The only policies which can be found within the <span class="caps">NPF</span> report on
transport are to take “the railways back into public ownership” and
“give local authorities franchising powers to run and manage their
local bus routes”. While the inadequacy and expense of public
transport are acknowledged, there are no concrete proposals to tackle either.</p>
<h3>Rail</h3>
<p>While the commitment to bring rail franchises back into public
ownership is laudable, there are many other questions to be answered
about rail. First, what is to happen to the Rolling Stock Companies
(ROSCOs) which lease the trains to the franchise operators? These are
<a href="http://www.cresc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/GTR%20Report%20final%205%20June%202013.pdf">obscenely profitable</a>,
take essentially no risk, and have failed to adequately invest in new
rolling stock. While nationalising franchises would cost essentially
nothing, the ROSCOs would be quite expensive. One approach would be
for the government to regulate them and trim the profit margins. Where
new rolling stock is introduced, it should be publicly owned. As
decarbonisation demands a campaign of rail electrification, plenty of
new stock will be required. It would be worth considering recreating
British Rail Engineering Limited to build this in-house.</p>
<p>Network Rail present another question. Currently it provides a hidden
subsidy to the train operators by charging
<a href="http://www.cresc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/GTR%20Report%20final%205%20June%202013.pdf">artificially low track access fees</a>. The
difference is made up by a government grant and borrowing. With each
infrastructure upgrade, its debt continues to
ballootheytheytheyn. While not sustainable, this has led to increased
investment compared to the days of British Rail, when funding was at
the whim of whoever was in government. A new model is clearly needed,
but what it should be is unclear. Furthermore, the question of exactly
<em>what</em> new investments are needed in rail (e.g. electrification) needs
to be addressed.</p>
<p>A final consideration for rail is how a newly nationalised sector
should be structured. It
<a href="http://www.redpepper.org.uk/getting-back-on-track-an-alternative-to-private-railways/">has been suggested</a>
that the railways should be more decentralised than they were under
British Rail. Allowing large local authorities to manage commuter
rail, in the model of London Overground, does seem
reasonable. However, devolving regional rail services risks continuing
the fragmentation which has marked the sector since
privatisation. Perhaps a compromise would be to have trains operated
by a single national company but allow local and regional governments
to be represented in the administration of regional routes.</p>
<h3>Buses</h3>
<p>It is welcome that the buses are acknowledged by the <span class="caps">NPF</span> and giving
local authorities more control over service is undoubtedly a good
idea. However, it is unclear what exactly is meant by “franchising
powers to run and manage their local bus routes”. Presumably it refers
to a system such as that in London where, even if a private company
operates the buses, they do so under contract with a local authority,
which sets and collects fares, determines routes, etc. Private
operators will
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/02/bus-battle-test-case-tyne-wear-privatisation">fight attempts</a>
by local authorities to do this, so the process should be tilted in
favour of the councils. Additionally, funding should be provided by
central government to help buy or create council-owned bus
companies. There should also be an emphasis of integrating buses and
local transport with the rail system. Regional and national buses were
not mentioned by the report. These should also be re-regulated and,
preferably, taken back into public ownership. There may be a role for
devolved administrations to play in the management of these
services. New buses should be electric, either being trolley-buses or
battery powered.</p>
<h3>Other Public Transport</h3>
<p>No reference at all is made to other forms of transport. It is worth
considering whether current ferry services are adequate and whether
these should be brought back into the public sector. Ferry service
could be integrated with rail so as to provide a seamless alternative
to flying. Rationalising air routes would also go some way to reducing
emissions from aviation, suggesting that renationalisation of airports
and re-regulation of airlines should be on the table. It would be
worth considering whether a rail tunnel could be built to Ireland to
replace many flights.</p>
<p>A running theme through all of this has been the need to integrate
transport across jurisdictions and modes. This would make public
transit a more viable alternative to driving and flying. There is a
strong argument for making local transport free at the point of use,
to make it more accessible to those on low incomes and to encourage
use by everyone. Regional and national travel would still require
fares, but a single, simple ticketing system should be adopted across
the entire country for buses, trains, and ferries, allowing trips to
be planned and purchased in a single place.</p>
<h3>Private Vehicles</h3>
<p>Private transport goes completely unmentioned by the <span class="caps">NPF</span>. While an
affordable and comprehensive mass transit system will go some way to
reducing the use of private automobiles, it obviously can not
eliminate it. A date should be set beyond which all cars sold in
Britain must be zero-emissions vehicles. For this to be practical, an
expansion in charging infrastructure is needed for electric cars. Fast
charging stations could be placed at existing petrol stations, while
(cheaper) slower ones could be placed in car-parks. A public
electrical company would be ideally placed to operate
these. Widespread adoption of electric vehicles would also be useful
in levelling out peaks in electricity demand, as owners could program
them to charge when demand is low (e.g. overnight) and, if necessary,
feed some of their energy back into the grid when demand is high.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Climate change is perhaps the greatest threat humanity has ever faced,
and mitigating it will be a task similar in scale to the conversion to
a wartime economy. The <span class="caps">NPF</span> displays no awareness of this fact and has
made no effort to draw up the detailed plans which will be
required. Instead they have contented themselves with vague, feel-good
slogans while ignoring crucial areas of climate policy. If Britain and
the rest of the world continue to take such an approach, then climate
change will be a catastrophe and perhaps even an existential threat to
future generations.</p>
