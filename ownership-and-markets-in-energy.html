            <p><em>I wrote this article for the</em> New Socialist <em>website, where
<a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk/ownership-and-markets-energy/">it appeared</a>
on 16 April 2018 with a few changes.</em></p>
<p>One of the most popular elements of Labour’s 2017 manifesto was the
pledge to
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/01/jeremy-corbyn-nationalisation-plans-voters-tired-free-markets">return energy to public ownership</a>.
At last year’s conference John McDonnell said “Rail, water, energy,
Royal Mail—we’re taking them back”. This makes it sound like he’s
pledging to renationalise energy, but examining Labour’s manifesto
policies it quickly becomes clear that he is either being deliberately
misleading or displaying a stunning lack of understanding of how the
energy sector functions in this country. Below, I will explain how
electricity was structured when it was publicly owned and how Margaret
Thatcher went about privatising it. I will then examine the technical
and democratic shortcomings of the electricity market which she
created. (While electricity only makes up
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-consumption-in-the-uk">20% of the <span class="caps">UK</span>’s energy use</a>,
electrifying the remaining 80% will form a key part of addressing
climate change, so I will use the terms interchangeably throughout
this article and have chosen not to look at gas and petrol markets.)
I go on to analyse exactly what Labour has promised and lay out why
their plan to move to a decentralised energy system is
implausible. Finally, I will argue that we should embrace the need for
national planning of the electricity sector and the centralised
ownership that entails.</p>
<h3>Nationalisation and Privatisation</h3>
<p>Nationalised electricity was once the norm across much of the world
and how Britain structured the industry was fairly typical.
The Central Electricity Generating Board (<span class="caps">CEGB</span>) owned all power plants
and the national grid. The distribution infrastructure (wires leading
into people’s homes) was owned by 14 area electricity boards. The <span class="caps">CEGB</span>
was responsible for ensuring that there was always sufficient
electricity supply for the country, which was bought by the area
electricity boards and then sold on to customers. Scotland had a
separate electricity company which handled all of generation,
transmission, distribution, and sales in that jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It was once thought that electricity was a natural monopoly, but
Margaret Thatcher showed much of the sector could be “liberalised” to
operate in a competitive environment. She split the <span class="caps">CEGB</span> into the
national grid and three generating companies. These were sold off over
a few years, along with the area electricity boards. A system was
introduced by which the electricity boards purchased electricity from
the generators on a national wholesale market. This was achieved
through a combination of bilateral contracts, real-time bidding, and a
futures market. After a transition period, retail companies were
allowed into the market to compete against the area electricity
boards, the latter being required to separate operation of the
distribution grid from the supply of electricity. Matching electricity
production to demand has gone from a technical exercise to something
more like the trading floor of the stock exchange. Yet even that is
not sufficient to make the grid function properly, because generators
and suppliers only trade with each other to cover half-hour
intervals. Demand varies on considerably shorter time scales so there
must also be a “capacity market” through which National Grid plc pays
generators to stay on standby and turn production up and down as
needed. Similar markets exist for other “ancillary services” such as
maintaining the correct voltage.</p>
<p>If ever you need an example of the role of the state in constructing
and maintaining markets, electricity is where you should look. None of
this could exist if not for government regulations. Nothing that
happens can be considered some sort of “natural” market outcome, as it
is a direct consequence of the decisions the government made when it
constructed the market. If the design is faulty then a serious crisis
can develop. We saw this in when the Canadian province of Ontario
liberalised electricity; after a few months the wholesale price
climbed so high that the market had to be suspended, to be replaced by
an even stranger quasi-liberalised system. A much more serious case was the
Enron scandal in California, where companies manipulated the market to
boost profits, causing blackouts.</p>
<h3>The Inevitability of Planning</h3>
<p>Beyond this, there is one fundamental
problems of electricity markets: they are really terrible at getting
sufficient investment. The old vertically-integrated companies used to
simply forecast demand and build accordingly, setting rates to cover
cost. In a liberalised electricity market, generators have to hope
that they can supply at the wholesale price, without being certain
what that price will be in 10, 20, or 50 years’ time. In practice,
building new power plants has often required the government to
guarantee a price for the generator. Risk has been shifted off of
the utility and back onto rate-payers, which is precisely what
liberalisation was supposed to avoid!</p>
<p>This is true for conventional energy sources, but the problem becomes
even worse with intermittent renewables. A wind farm on its own isn’t
of much use to the grid, because its output can’t be set to meet
demand. Somehow you need to ensure that there are sufficient other
mechanisms to adjust supply and/or demand to be equal, regardless of
how quickly the wind is blowing. This has been a
serious problem for the government’s attempts to incentivise green
energy and can result in some very inefficient
decisions. Fortunately, researchers at Imperial College have developed
a model which can determine the cheapest combination of energy sources
to achieve this “system integration”. In
<a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/system-integration-costs-for-alternative-low-carbon-generation-technologies-policy-implications/">a report</a>
commissioned by the Committee on Climate Change, we are told that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A range of market and regulatory mechanisms and commercial
arrangements exist to allocate and recover system integration
costs. Ideally, such arrangements should ensure that the operational
and investment decisions made by private entities achieve outcomes as
close as possible to the theoretical ideal prescribed by Imperial’s modelling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is being said is that the government is trying to construct the
market so that it will choose what we already know to be the optimal
outcome. The absurdity of this should be apparent.</p>
<p>The only solution is to start to move away from markets. To
an extent this is acknowledged in an independent report to the government
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cost-of-energy-independent-review">proposing a set of reforms</a>. In
simple terms, these would see the national transmission grid operator
putting contracts out to tender for new generating capacity, with the
requirement that the winner be able to meet certain levels of demand
when needed. The generating company would then be responsible for
getting the correct mix of generation, storage infrastructure, and
demand management to achieve this, likely via subcontracting.</p>
<p>What we would see, then, is the nation’s electricity supply being
planned in little pieces.  The problem is not the presence of
planning, <em>per se</em>, but the fact that it is being done by
unaccountable private firms. The piecemeal nature also prevents
economies of scale, leading to more expensive electricity. Similarly,
it is likely that by planning the grid as a whole we could arrive at a
more optimal solution than planning it as many small units
(<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/reaction-dieter-helms-least-cost-ideas-for-meeting-the-uk-climate-targets">as critics of the report have noted</a>).</p>
<h3>Labour’s Unfocused Vision</h3>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>What does all of this have to do with Labour?” I hear you
cry. “Didn’t they promise to nationalise the Big 6?” While last year’s
manifesto was often reported that way (including in a breathless
Momentum email after it was leaked), no such promises were made. We
are
<a href="https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/creating-economy-works/#eighth">told that</a>
Labour will “regain control of energy supply networks through the alteration of
operator license conditions, and transition to a publicly owned,
decentralised energy system.” The
<a href="https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/creating-economy-works/#ninth">following steps</a>
are laid out to achieve this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Regaining control of energy supply networks through the alteration of
the National and Regional Network Operator license conditions.</li>
<li>Supporting the creation of publicly owned, locally accountable energy
companies and co-operatives to rival existing private energy
suppliers, with at least one in every region.</li>
<li>Legislating to permit publicly owned local companies to purchase
the regional grid infrastructure, and to ensure that national and
regional grid infrastructure is brought into public ownership over time.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The only nationalisation mentioned here is of the grid, and this is
only “over time”. Any energy retailers will have to compete against
the Big 6. Given that “Labour understands that many people don’t have
time to shop around, they just want reliable and affordable energy”,
it is exceptionally odd that their solution is to create a seventh
choice in the market.</p>
<p>Strikingly, absolutely nothing is said about electricity
<em>generation</em>. No commitments are made to buy out existing
power plants and only vague statements are given on ownership of new
infrastructure. We are told that Labour supports new projects
such as carbon capture and storage, renewables, and
nuclear, but not who will own them. The accompanying
<a href="http://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Richer-Britain-Richer-Lives-Labours-Industrial-Strategy.pdf">report on industrial strategy</a>
commits to “support local renewable energy generation” but doesn’t
define what this means. Could “local” include ownership by small
businesses? Would that be any more democratic that ownership by the
Big 6? The report also pledges to continue to support <em>private</em>
development of schemes such as the Swansea tidal lagoon, Hinckley C,
and a potential nuclear power plant at Moorside. Offshore wind
development is endorsed, but no clue is given over ownership,
especially considering no one is particularly “local” to an offshore
wind farm.</p>
<p>Labour has also spoken about encouraging the installation of solar
panels on houses. This idea is technically, socially, and
ideologically unsound. As
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/01/solar-panel-feed-in-tariff">George Monbiot explains</a>,
it is technically unsound because solar panels produce the most
electricity in the summer and the middle of the day, and little or
none at periods of peak demand. It is socially unsound because it
means that those people sufficiently well-off to own a house are given
generous subsidies for solar panels, paid for by higher energy
bills for everyone else. And it is ideologically unsound because it
represents a petty-bourgeois, individualised vision of addressing
climate change, in which power production becomes a literal cottage
industry for which households must take personal responsibility.</p>
<p>Being charitable, it sounds like Labour wants to support the
development of cooperative and local-authority owned renewable energy
sources, rather than seeking national ownership. This is similar to
the approach promoted by the
<a href="https://weownit.org.uk/public-ownership/energy">We Own It</a> campaign
and by
<a href="http://www.psiru.org/sites/default/files/2016-04-E-UK-public.pdf">David Hall</a>
of the University of Greenwich. They point to the success of existing supply
companies like Robin Hood Energy (owned by Nottingham City Council)
and to Germany where “council owned energy companies supply around
half of the market”. They are also enthusiastic about the “democratic”
system of numerous small, locally controlled energy companies which
will bring the “clean, green, decentralised energy future we need”.</p>
<p>It is very odd that public suppliers competing with private ones
is the model offered here, given that most on the Left would reject
that as a half-measure if proposed for the railways. Competition would
probably require the continued operation of the electricity market. It
would certainly prevent full public control over tariff structures, as
anything which benefits the poor at the expense of the rich or
households at the expense of business would simply cause the worse-off
party to switch to a competitor. If we really want to meet people’s
desire for “reliable and affordable energy” without them having to
“shop around”, it would be better to have a single supply company in
any given area, which also operates the distribution grid. This would
likely be more efficient than the competitive market, as it would
prevent needless duplication, advertising, and the bureaucracy needed
to switch suppliers.</p>
<p>However, what I find truly bizarre about these proposals is that
Left-wing people are advocating for energy co-ops.  In most sectors, a
co-operative is owned by its employees or its customers. In rural
parts of North America there do exist electricity supply consumer
co-operatives, but this is not what people are talking about
here. Instead, locals would become members of the co-operative by
paying to finance new energy projects. Given how energy is regulated,
it is impossible for them to then buy their power from the co-op, so
instead it sells its power into the market and returns the profits to
its investors as dividends. These are fairly generous dividends at
that: the
<a href="https://brightonenergy.org.uk/">Brighton Energy Co-operative</a> aims to
make a 5% return on investment each year, which is substantially
higher than the cost of servicing public-sector borrowing. Whatever
their talk of “community ownership”, energy co-ops would appear to
have far more in common with Margaret Thatcher’s “share-owning
democracy” than with socialism. We should be seeking to sell energy at
cost, rather than use energy bills as a way to pay a low-risk,
comfortable rate of return to middle class people looking for a
feel-good investment. We certainly should not make participation in
decision-making around energy contingent on being able to pay £300 to
buy shares (the minimum purchase for the Brighton Energy Co-operative).</p>
<h3>The Localist Fantasy</h3>
<p>Even leaving co-ops of this sort aside and assuming that local
authorities will own the generators, there are evident problems with
Labour’s policies. The market is never mentioned here and no proposals
are made for reforms.  We are not told how these new democratic energy
companies will interact with each other and with the existing private
components of the market. It is implied that energy will increasingly
be generated locally, allowing for easy democratic control and
bypassing the market. To the extent that energy needs to be imported
from elsewhere, we are forced to conclude it will be sourced from the
energy market more-or-less as it exists now.</p>
<p>This is a problem. Few places in the <span class="caps">UK</span> will ever be self-sufficient
in energy. To generate, on average, <span class="caps">50GW</span> of electricity from wind (this
being roughly equal to current peak demand, which will only grow as we
phase out gas and petrol) would require
<a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/c4/page_33.shtml">covering about 10% of the country</a>
in wind farms. That might not sound like a huge amount, but
considering that
<a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/nr/land-cover-atlas-uk-1.744440">only 6% of the <span class="caps">UK</span> is “built upon”</a>,
the scale of the task quickly becomes apparent. Most people live in
cities, where there is simply not enough room for much energy
generation to be “local” to them.</p>
<p>It gets worse. Those who are against tackling climate change often ask
“what happens when the wind isn’t blowing?” Though arguing in bad
faith, they make a valid point. There is an issue of “intermittency”
in wind, solar, wave, and (to a lesser extent) tidal power. When these
sources are part of a broader mix then other power plants can easily
adjust their output to take the load. However, what happens if half of
your power comes from intermittent sources? What if it’s 100%?  What’s
left to take the load?  In countries without massive hydroelectric or
geothermal resources it’s not clear that 100% renewable energy is even possible.</p>
<p>One of the answers put forward to address this is the “European
super-grid”, connecting renewable resources in different countries so,
e.g., Danish wind could provide power to the <span class="caps">UK</span> when it is calm over
Britain, and vice versa. This could certainly help with the worst
lulls, although
<a href="http://euanmearns.com/wind-blowing-nowhere/">considerable variability remains</a>. Regardless,
the requirement for not only a national grid but a continental one
clearly cuts against the argument that we can have local energy. We
also hear about the potential of different storage technologies. If
we’re being honest, the only one of these which <em>might</em> be able to
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914010290">work on a sufficient scale</a>
is pumped-hydro, which can only operate in certain areas and thus is
inherently non-local for most people. There are suggestions about a
“smart-grid” which can adjust demand to meet supply, but this could
only be a part of the solution and would therefore have to work on the
(supra-)national scale. Maybe we could make everything work if
different renewable energy and storage infrastructure is carefully
selected and sited to compliment each other, but who is going to
coordinate this in a decentralised system? We’d be back to the current
problem of trying to plan the market.</p>
<p>Even leaving the issue of coordination aside, in practice this model
leaves much to be desired. In principle, all of the wind-farms, dams,
solar panels, etc. could be publicly owned by different local
authorities. They could then trade electricity on the national market,
much as happens between the Big 6 now. However, we’re quickly losing
any semblance of local control and accountability, with electricity
coming from the National Grid, purchased on a contract with who-knows
which generating company, who may well have subcontracted to another
company. Gaps would be filled by hedging and buying on the spot
market. The local supply companies would only be able to choose from
what is available on the market and generating companies would only be
able to build what they think they could sell. This market mediation
would seriously encumber democratic decision making.</p>
<h3><span class="dquo">“</span>Local” is not a Synonym for “Democracy”</h3>
<p>I do not see any way to have significant local ownership of
energy production without a national electricity market and all of the
insanity that entails. It would be much more transparent and easier to
understand if we were to develop a national plan for energy (with
local consultation, of course). Generation and transmission would be
owned by a single national Power Generation Board. Distribution and
retail could, if desired, operate on a regional or local level,
leaving some room for local input into exact tariff structures. The
downside to this is that people in low density areas (with greater
infrastructure requirements) will likely end up paying more than those
in big cities. In any case, the big decisions about what sort of
energy we want and where to build the infrastructure are inherently
national in scale. The Left needs to face the fact that only a
centralised model for generation is likely to achieve the economies of
scale and capacity for planning which we will need to get ourselves
off of fossil fuels. Despite the obvious risk that such a centralised
institution would be aloof from local concerns, the improved
transparency of decision-making would still make this the more
democratic approach.</p>
<p>Indeed, conflation of “democratic” with “local” is something we should
be suspicious of. Certainly local control has its place, but that does
not mean it is the best choice in all cases. We need to
examine what we mean when we say something is “democratic”, as was
argued in
<a href="https://bravenewclimate.com/2014/06/11/germany-energiewende-oz-critical-review/">an article</a>
surveying Germany’s famous Energiewende (the name for their attempted
move towards renewable energy):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is interesting the way in which the language of German
environmentalism has become incorporated into an Australian
environmentalist narrative… [It] was the German
[solar energy feed-in-tariff] model that became the template for
small-scale support mechanisms from the 1990s. This became aligned
with the concept of democratised energy, which was imported into
Australia via green groups and solar advocates.</p>
<p>What makes the democracy idea interesting in an Australian context is
that there is little precedent for the concept in relation to
utilities and public services—indeed, Australians generally express
a preference for socialised public services (such as Medicare)…
It is easier for a household to go “off-grid” for their
water supply, for example, yet nobody discusses “the suburban
democratisation of water”….</p>
<p>In contrast, the democratisation of personal transport—motor
cars—is strongly critiqued by green groups in favour of the
socialised model of urban transport—trains and public transport. So
we can see that the “democratised” model is really an opportunistic
use of language—democracy is adopted as a universal virtue and
associated with a value-laden cause, rather than representing a
coherent argument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One can see parallels and similar inconsistencies in this country.
For example, the Left favours national management of the <span class="caps">NHS</span>, feeling
this to be more accountable and thus “democratic”. Yet, for some
reason, a fragmented and competitive system is viewed as “democratic”
in energy despite it bearing more resemblance to the present Health
and Social Care Act than the vision of the
<a href="http://www.nhsbillnow.org/"><span class="caps">NHS</span> Reinstatement Bill</a>. So, what do we
actually mean by democracy? To me, it means that everyone who is
affected by a decision should be involved in the decision. Some
issues will inherently involve vast numbers of people and therefore
must be dealt with on that scale. Energy is one example of this.</p>
<p>Desire to cut oneself off from other people and be totally
self-sufficient is a hallmark of the lunatic fringe of the
Right. Human beings are social creatures who depend upon
each other for survival. As socialists we acknowledge and embrace
this, fighting for the system managing these inter-dependencies to be
fair, transparent, and democratic. If we want a democratic energy
system, then we must abolish the electricity market and embrace the
accountable, centralised control that entails, rather than retreat
into conservative fantasies of local self-reliance.</p>
