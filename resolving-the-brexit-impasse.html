        <section class="article">
            <p>Well, we finally have a proposed agreement by which the <span class="caps">UK</span> could
withdraw from the <span class="caps">EU</span>. It’s just a pity that no one actually agrees
with it. In fact, disagreeing with it is about the only thing the House of
Commons can agree on.</p>
<h3>The Situation as it Stands</h3>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, smart-assed comments aside, the Brexit process is in dire
straights. With barely more than 100 days until Brexit, Theresa May
has secured a deal which the <span class="caps">EU</span> insists is not up for any
renegotiation. However, her MPs (and the Democratic Unionists, on
whose votes she relies) won’t pass it because of the controversial
“backstop” measure. Should the <span class="caps">UK</span> and <span class="caps">EU</span> fail to negotiate a
post-Brexit agreement which would prevent the re-assertion of a “hard
border” in Northern Ireland, the backstop will automatically enter
into effect at the end of Britain’s two year “transition period”. It
provides something similar to single-market membership (although with
some important differences).<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Terminating the backstop will require
mutual consent of both the <span class="caps">UK</span> and <span class="caps">EU</span>, causing some to fear that the <span class="caps">EU</span>
will trap Britain in a perpetual “Brexit in name only”.</p>
<p>I understand why the <span class="caps">EU</span> wants this. They need a guarantee the Northern
Irish border will remain open. The backstop wouldn’t be able to
offer that if the <span class="caps">UK</span> could unilaterally renege. That said, I also
completely understand why MPs are uncomfortable with this; signing an
agreement which you can not get out of is a risk.</p>
<p>For its part, the Labour Party was never going to accept any deal
which the Tories brought to parliament. Their six tests were designed
to be impossible to achieve from the start.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Rather than put any
serious work into fleshing out what they’d like Brexit to look like,
alongside various alternatives should the <span class="caps">EU</span> prove unforthcoming in
negotiations, they’ve taken an obstructionist stance. I suspect this
is in an attempt to manage the internal contradictions within the
party. Its members are majority pro-<span class="caps">EU</span>, but a majority of its
constituencies voted to leave. To get elected requires the votes of
both Remainers and Leavers. The party’s current stance has proven
sufficiently ambiguous that it hasn’t alienated either of these
groups, but a serious discussion of how to go about Brexit would
likely do just that.</p>
<p>So there is no way the deal is getting through parliament. However,
without a deal, the <span class="caps">UK</span> will automatically exit the <span class="caps">EU</span> on 29 March. It
would revert to <span class="caps">WTO</span> rules for trade with the <span class="caps">EU</span>, while Europeans
living in Britain would be left in a legal limbo of being neither
legal nor illegal. None of the bilateral treaties which normally
facilitate commerce, trade, and travel between countries would exist
and nor would the infrastructure needed to process trade without such
benefits. This would likely cause massive backlogs at ports of entry
which are predicted to lead to shortages of food and medicines, as
well as halt any manufacturing which depends on European supply chains.</p>
<h3>The Irish Question</h3>
<p>The real root of the problem is Northern Ireland. Key to the Good
Friday Agreement was keeping a soft border between Ireland and
Ulster. However, so the logic goes, a soft border is only possible
with a high degree of regulatory harmonisation and free movement of
goods, people, and services, i.e. membership of the Single
Market. Thus, any attempt to take the <span class="caps">UK</span> out of the Single Market was
always going to cause problems.</p>
<p>In many regards this is the tail wagging the dog. A tiny region with
less than 2 million people, disconnected from the country at large, is
preventing the results of a referendum in which 33 million people
voted from being implemented. What’s more, it’s a region which is
only part of the <span class="caps">UK</span> due to past imperialism. In many ways, the tidiest
solution would be a united Ireland (which may actually happen,
depending on how Brexit proceeds, although not in time to make
negotiations any more straightforward).</p>
<p>Anyway, barring that, there are limited options. One is to give
Northern Ireland special status within the <span class="caps">UK</span>, so that it remains
within the Single Market while Great Britain leaves. There would thus
need to be customs on goods moving between the two; i.e., the hard
border would lie in the Irish Sea. That is certainly much more
practical to implement than a hard border between Northern Ireland and
the Republic of Ireland and it is sort of the inverse of the current
situation with overseas territories of <span class="caps">EU</span> member states (e.g., islands
in the Caribbean). The <span class="caps">EU</span> appears to be open to this option, but it is
unpopular with Unionists and has been completely ruled out by the
Democratic Unionist Party supporting Theresa May in parliament.</p>
<p>Another option would be to accept that the border won’t be quite as
soft as it has been in the past, but pursue every possible means to
minimise it. This has been achieved to some degree at the Swiss border
using digital systems to process customs in advance and avoid the use
of checkpoints. If coupled with limited checks between Northern
Ireland and Britain (e.g., for transport of animals) then this <em>might</em>
be technically achievable. However, it doesn’t look like Ireland or
the <span class="caps">EU</span> would consider it sufficient to meet their requirements. It’s
also not clear that the Northern Irish themselves would accept
it. However, if such a system could be implemented then it might
conceivably represent a means to get out of the backstop.</p>
<h3>What Should We Want?</h3>
<p>So far I’ve been discussing this purely in terms of what can get
through parliament as it stands now. However, there is also the
question of what the Left would like as an outcome. Most supported
Remain and would thus prefer to simply revoke Brexit and stay in the
<span class="caps">EU</span>. As such, there has been a lot of demand for a second referendum on
the final terms of the deal. However, many other Remainers are worried
about that, feeling that we need to respect the democratic decision of
the original referendum and fearing not doing so could massively
embolden the reactionary Right. And then there are those, such as
myself, who think that pursuing socialism will be impossible within
the <span class="caps">EU</span> and would thus like a Brexit which gets the <span class="caps">UK</span> out of Single
Market rules which inhibit state aid, enforce open competition, and
forbid capital controls.</p>
<p>This entails a relatively hard Brexit. While I don’t object in
principle to Labour’s desire for a customs union with the <span class="caps">EU</span> which
nonetheless would not bind the <span class="caps">UK</span> to neoliberal <span class="caps">EU</span> policy, I don’t
think such a deal is likely to be forthcoming. Given that, the <span class="caps">UK</span>
should have told Northern Ireland that one way or another Britain will
be leaving the Single Market and the customs union. It would then have
been up to them whether this would mean a united Ireland, special
status for Northern Ireland within the <span class="caps">UK</span>, or some hardening of the
Northern Irish border. Of course, it would be necessary to evaluate
whether any or all of these outcomes would be likely to restart the
Troubles (although I’m inclined to doubt they would). Assuming they
wouldn’t, these choices could be put to the Northern Irish people in a
ranked-choice referendum.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">UK</span> would then get to work establishing negotiating a framework to
leave the Single Market. This wouldn’t happen immediately and would
require at least a couple years of transition period, during which the
<span class="caps">UK</span> is outside of the <span class="caps">EU</span> but inside the Single Market. This would
provide time to negotiate the agreements necessary for a hard Brexit
to work. These would not necessarily be free trade agreements in the
sense of eliminating tariffs; with the exception of a few sectors,
tariffs would probably be low enough to be manageable. The real issue
is all the other barriers to trade such as regulatory inspections,
paperwork around customs, sanitary provisions for the export of live
animals, etc.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Agreements exist with other countries which would
harmonise and expedite all of this sufficiently to allow relatively
smooth trade. However, it would take time to negotiate and implement
these for the <span class="caps">UK</span>, hence the need of a transitional period within the
Single Market. This could potentially take the form of a phased
withdrawal, with different aspects of Single Market membership being
dropped over time (assuming the <span class="caps">EU</span> would agree, of course). For
example, liberalisation directives for railways might be dropped
immediately, on the condition that <span class="caps">UK</span> rail companies would no longer
be eligible to bid for <span class="caps">EU</span> operating contracts. This would allow Labour
to immediately begin the process of taking the railways back into
public ownership.</p>
<p>There’s not guarantee that these negotiations would be easy and at
least some aspects of them would probably drag on for many
years. However, it at the very least seems like a more reality-based
plan than what the Labour Party is currently calling for. However, now
we are at a point where there is no time to negotiate such
an agreement.</p>
<h3>The Options Before Us</h3>
<p>At this point, there are really only three plausible options:</p>
<ol>
<li>The deal which the <span class="caps">EU</span> has offered (or something very similar).</li>
<li>No deal.</li>
<li>Remaining.</li>
</ol>
<p>Labour continues to call for a general election to resolve the
parliamentary deadlock and while I would be pleased with anything
which would get the Tories out of government, whoever succeeds them
will face the same set of choices as we do now. Unfortunately,
publicly at least, Labour has not realised that. At a recent
Constituency Labour Party meeting I asked the local <span class="caps">MP</span> (who is in the
Shadow Treasury Team) what Labour would like to change about the
existing deal and it basically came down wanting a commitment a
permanent customs union. I’m given to understand that the <span class="caps">EU</span> is not
willing to negotiate such agreements at this point,<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> but even if
that’s not the case there is simply no time to negotiate a customs
union before Brexit day. Perhaps the <span class="caps">EU</span> could be convinced to extend
the negotiation period, but it would require all 27 other member
states to agree and this is by no means guaranteed.</p>
<h4>This Deal</h4>
<p>No one on the Left likes the current deal. It would lock the <span class="caps">UK</span> into
Single Market rules (including all of the neoliberal ones) without
having any say over them, at least until the backstop is over. The
attached (non-binding) political declaration indicates a desire for
any future agreement negotiated by the Tories to do much the same
around issues of state aid and competition.As such, not only
Remainers object to the current settlement, but most Leavers
too. However, Chris Bickerton (a left-Leaver and European scholar who
wrote
<em><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/293/293941/the-european-union--a-citizen-s-guide/9780141983097.html">The European Union: A Citizen’s Guide</a></em>)
has argued that at this point it is the best we are going to get, that
the <span class="caps">EU</span> has ample incentive not to keep the <span class="caps">UK</span> trapped in the backstop,
and that it represents something from which we can negotiate
improvements.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
<h4>No Deal</h4>
<p>For the most part, only the Right has flirted with the prospect of No
Deal, believing it would give them <em>carte blanche</em> to turn the <span class="caps">UK</span> into
a libertarian free-trade hellhole. Most people reject it out of hand,
given the projection of shortages, planes being grounded, and Kent
being turned into a car-park for lorries that aren’t being allowed
into Calais.  Nonetheless, at least one left-Leaver has suggested that
we should take this option, viewing it as the option least likely to
constrain a future socialist government.<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> A number of pro-Brexit
sources have sought to downplay fears around No Deal, although many of
them are based on arguments of how other countries trade with the <span class="caps">EU</span>
while ignoring the numerous treaties which they have negotiated to
make this possible.<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
<p>While some contingency plans have been agreed
between the <span class="caps">UK</span> and <span class="caps">EU</span> in case of a No Deal outcome and both parties
have made some unilateral preparations, these hardly appear sufficient
to avoid at least some disruption.
As far as I can tell, what would be likely to occur in the event of No
Deal would be a failure to enforce the usual rules of international
trade. Britain would likely continue to treat trade entering the
country the same was as the day before, despite the fact this would
technically violate <span class="caps">WTO</span> rules (as they would be favouring some nations
over others, without having free trade agreements). It’s harder to
predict the actions of the <span class="caps">EU</span>, as they’d be less affected by the
cessation of trade and would thus have less incentive to bend
rules. It appears only minimal air service would be permitted. It
seems clear that neither the <span class="caps">UK</span> nor Ireland have any plan of enforcing
the Northern Irish border in the event of No Deal, so who knows what
the legal status of trade would be there. The best that could be hoped
for in this outcome is that basic trade would be allowed to prevent
the <span class="caps">UK</span> from collapsing and that the chaos would force the <span class="caps">EU</span> and <span class="caps">UK</span> to
rush through the agreements necessary to make trade possible. All
things considered, to me this does not sound like an outcome the Left
should permit.</p>
<h4>Remain</h4>
<p>The Labour Party is divided on the prospect of a second referendum (in
Oxford, a motion calling on the leadership to call for one and
campaign for remain passed by only a few votes). As a solution, it
comes with an awful lot of practical problems of its own. There are
questions of what exactly the question would be and what options would
be available. May’s deal and no deal? May’s deal and remain? All
three? It would also almost certainly be impossible to pass the
requisite legislation and hold the legally-required campaign prior to
Brexit Day and very difficult to do so before the coming spring’s <span class="caps">EU</span>
elections (by which time the <span class="caps">EU</span> wants the <span class="caps">UK</span> to have left). But,
without another referendum, Remaining could massively undermine the
legitimacy of the <span class="caps">UK</span>’s democratic institutions (and they aren’t in
great shape already). I suppose the <span class="caps">UK</span> could withdraw its invocation
of Article 50, thus cancelling Brexit, and then reactivate it should
Leave win the referendum, but I’d imagine this would be a tough sell.</p>
<p>There is also the question of whether Labour could implement its
policies within the <span class="caps">EU</span>. Lots of people claim it can, but they don’t
seem to know about the 4th Railway Package which insists that in
future all routes either be put out to tender or be open to
competition from other operators. This would seem to limit Labour’s
pledge to renationalise the railways to having a public operator
compete for franchises, as was party policy under Ed Miliband. At the
time this was seen by the Left as a half measure meant to avoid talk
of nationalisation. The other major issue is capital controls. While
Labour hasn’t really talked about these, historically the Post-War
Consensus relied on such controls and capital flight has often been
able to undermine radical Left governments. The real issue, though, is
that even if Labour’s last manifesto may have been permitted under <span class="caps">EU</span>
law, more radical policy (which we should be pushing towards) would
not.<sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Some suggest, with varying degrees of reluctance or excitement, a
“Remain and Reform” position.<sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> I think this is naive about
prospects for reform. Despite the rhetoric you sometimes hear about
uniting with other socialists within Europe, this usually means social
democrats that I do not believe will work for the policies
required. I’ve yet to see a serious strategy for how to go about
achieving reforms, given the massive democratic deficit inherent in <span class="caps">EU</span>
bodies and the lack of any European demos.<sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> If we are to pursue
this approach then it seems to me that the only practical policy is
“Remain and <em>Rebel</em>“, knowingly and wilfully violating neoliberal <span class="caps">EU</span>
directives and refusing to obey <span class="caps">ECJ</span> rulings against the <span class="caps">UK</span>. We’d have
to hope this would expose the <span class="caps">EU</span> for the neoliberal machine it is and
create a movement for reform, before any retaliatory sanctions become
too unbearable. Unfortunately, hardly anyone in Labour conceives of Remain
this way and I have serious doubts that it could work. As
circumstances change, that may yet become the best strategy, but I
don’t think we’re there yet.</p>
<p>One final note on this. The <span class="caps">EU</span> has a history of repeating, or outright
ignoring, referenda which went against further integration. I admit
that part of my resistance to another referendum is the feeling that
it continues this dangerous and undemocratic history. This despite the
fact that the arguments for a second referendum in this case are far
better than those in previous ones. I’m not saying this is a strong
argument on my part, but it is there in the back of my mind
nonetheless. More importantly that this would perpetuate the whole
narrative that There Is No Alternative to the <span class="caps">EU</span>. I’m deeply
uncomfortable with the precedent this would create indicating leaving
the <span class="caps">EU</span> is impossible.</p>
<h3>So, What’s the Best Choice?</h3>
<p>No, I’m not going to borrow that old cliche from Lenin… Nonetheless,
clearly the Left needs some sort of strategy going forward. For what
it’s worth, I think that the best choice is accepting something like
the current deal. It’s not a good deal, but I found Bickerton’s
arguments for it far more convincing than arguments for No Deal and
I’m not at the point yet where I think we should go for Remain.</p>
<p>Were I leading the Parliamentary Labour Party, I would go through the
agreement with a fine-toothed comb and find exactly what the most
problematic aspects of it are. I would then write up a series of
amendments I would like to see. At present I can think of a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the backstop only apply to Northern Ireland, which the <span class="caps">EU</span> was
  open to in the past</li>
<li>If that proves possible, add a referendum in Northern Ireland as a
  way of ending the backstop</li>
<li>Removal of commitments in the political declaration (detailing plans
  for negotiation future agreements) dealing with maintaining <span class="caps">EU</span> rules
  on state aid, competition, etc. If the Tories won’t agree to that,
  then ask them to leave these in as only a <em>possible</em> path.</li>
<li>Clarification that, should there be a change of government prior to
  finalising the post-Brexit agreements, the new administration can
  change its negotiating priorities</li>
<li>A commitment that all future agreements can be will be open to
  renegotiation and will not lock in either party in perpetuity</li>
</ul>
<p>Labour would then offer to help Theresa May pass her Brexit agreement
<em>if she can get these amendments and commits to triggering a general
election immediately afterwords</em>. The first of these would, of course,
alienate the Democratic Unionists and a good number of Tories, but
hopefully Labour would be able to marshal sufficient numbers in
parliament that this would not be a problem. Should May then try to
renege on holding a general election, the Unionists would almost
certainly give a vote of no confidence against her, bring the
government down anyway.</p>
<p>Of course, the <span class="caps">EU</span> probably won’t agree to all demands. They’re
insisting that the deal is now closed. The first demand
is something they’ve proposed in the past themselves, though, so if
changes can be made it would be that one. The penultimate point
wouldn’t require reopening the withdrawal agreement and would likely
just be an annex to the political declaration (which is itself
non-binding), so it should be achievable. This is the commitment which I
think should be an absolute red line. If Labour can’t get that out of
either the Tories or the <span class="caps">EU</span> then it is time to start thinking about
Remain as an option. </p>
<p>There are, of course, risks to this approach. If Theresa May or the <span class="caps">EU</span>
won’t apply the backstop only to Northern Ireland then there is
nothing to ensure she’ll stick to her promise to hold new
elections. Or, Labour might lose those elections. This, of course, is
the risk of democracy: sometimes people disagree with you. Elections
could also yield a similarly unworkable parliament. However, in that
case the backstop would kick in, so there wouldn’t be an immediate
threat to the economy like now. It would essentially stabilise us on
the status quo. Labour’s capacity to fight to change the <span class="caps">EU</span> rules
would be little changed from what it is now (i.e., extremely limited)
and rebelling would be about equally effective. If that really is the
best we can achieve then we could consider trying to transfer to <span class="caps">EFTA</span>/<span class="caps">EEA</span>
membership, which would likely have some minor advantages over the backstop.<sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>
<p>The final question is whether this would be seen as Labour conspiring
with the Tories, causing a wave of anti-establishment disgust with the
party. I hope that demanding amendments to the agreement would help
to mitigate this. Even without those amendments, however, I don’t see
the risks as being any worse than those of backing another referendum
to Remain.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Brexit looks set to be the defining issue in <span class="caps">UK</span> politics for the
foreseeable future. As an issue it is uniquely polarising and one
about which few have shown any ability to hold informed
discussion. Both of the major parties are deeply divided on the issue
and it will be incredibly difficult for either of them to pursue a
coherant policy. Although I hope I’m wrong, at this point it is
starting to feel inevitable that there will be another
referendum. Though I think there is little prospect of it being
adopted, I hope something like my strategy might provide a way to keep
Labour relatively united, avoid alienating to many voters on either
side, and prevent any serious economic damage. At the same time, it
would keep open the possibility of negotiating a permanent deal which
would allow a Left government to begin to challenge capitalism in the
<span class="caps">UK</span>.</p>
