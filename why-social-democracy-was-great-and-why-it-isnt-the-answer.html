        <section class="article">
            <p>Yesterday I happened to read two very interesting articles, which at first 
glance would appear to be entirely unrelated. One was in <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929254.600-the-wonder-year-why-1978-was-the-best-year-ever.html#.UeCPGt9hLCc"><em>New Scientist</em></a>
magazine and explained that, although <span class="caps">GDP</span> has risen fairly steadily in the west for the past several decades, the Genuine Progress Indicator (<span class="caps">GPI</span>) has slowly 
been declining since 1978. The <span class="caps">GPI</span> essentially tries to
adjust the value of <span class="caps">GDP</span> to account for social and environmental problems (such 
as inequality and pollution). The other article was an opinion
piece in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/25/europe-leaders-not-turning-austerity"><em>The Guardian</em></a> by two Canadian academics and activists
that I am rather fond of: Leo Panitch and Sam Gindin. Here they explained why 
we can’t expect any attempt at a second New Deal in Europe as a way of 
combating the economic crisis: in short, without a
threat of something more radical (ie: all-out socialism), the ruling classes see
no need to engage in progressive economic policies.</p>
<p><img alt="Graphs show that GDP has been consistently rising since 1950, while GPI has 
been in decline since the late 1970s." src="https://politicalphysicist.github.io/images/gpiPlots.jpg"/>
This set of graphs, taken from <em>New Scientist</em>‘s website, shows that global <span class="caps">GDP</span>
and <span class="caps">GPI</span> rose fairly steadily from 1950 to the late 1970s. 
This corresponds with the period in which Keynesianism ruled. This usually
took the form of social democracy: public ownership of key industries, strong 
trade unions, lots of regulation, a large welfare state, etc. As Panitch and
Gindin explain, the reason that this could be implemented was because there
were powerful working-class forces at work which could have led to the outright
abolition of capitalism. Faced with the prospect of losing everything, the upper
classes were willing to sacrifice a little wealth and power in order to pacify
the lower classes. This also was reflected in American foreign policy: the <span class="caps">US</span>
established the Marshall Plan in Europe to ensure that capitalism survived 
there, thus helping to ensure its survival in the <span class="caps">USA</span> as well.</p>
<p>As you can see from the above plot, these policies were quite successful at 
ensuring increased quality of life for all. However, the welfare state was 
always dependent on the success in the private sector for revenue (with a few
exceptions, nationalised industries were not used as major revenue sources). 
Thus social democracy has always been dependent on continued capital 
accumulation. And this was its fundamental weakness. When the global slump
came in the 1970s (in Britain it was so severe that you see a large decrease
in <span class="caps">GPI</span> around 1975) it began to put the welfare state in jeopardy. In some 
countries there were attempts to break away from the dependence on private
capital accumulation (the Meidner Plan in Sweden and Mitterrand’s 
nationalisation of banks in France) but the working class was not strong enough
to bring these attempts to a successful conclusion. In all countries it 
eventually proved necessary
to start scaling back the welfare state and, to one degree or another, abandon
Keynesian policies in favour of Monetarist ones. This new economic orthodoxy is
usually referred to as neoliberalism.</p>
<p>In Britain this took the form of Margaret Thatcher. In the <span class="caps">US</span> it was Ronald
Reagan. In Canada it was Brian Mulroney. All of them implemented policies which
were harmful to the average citizen. Trade unions were weakened and could no
longer act as a force against income inequality. Industries previously devoted
to the public good were privatised and used to enrich a select few. Cuts to 
social spending hurt the poor by making once universal services available only
to those that could pay. Deregulation made it easier for companies to pollute
the environment and the emphasis on private profit meant that environmental
costs were ignored. The reasons for declining <span class="caps">GPI</span> are clear. What is less clear
is what to do about it.</p>
<p>Panitch and Gindin show that today we lack the popular forces which made 
social democracy viable in the post-war period. There are no significant 
examples of non-capitalist states and few radical trade unions. In the minds of
most people there is no alternative to capitalism. Anti-capitalist parties are 
small and marginal (with a few exceptions, such as in Greece and, to a lesser 
extent, Spain and Portugal). The business class need not
fear the imposition of socialism; they know that the working class is currently
too disorganized to be a serious threat and thus see no need to pursue a policy
of appeasement. </p>
<p>Now, this situation will very likely change in the coming years and 
decades, but there are a few questions we should address as we work to create 
new working-class institutions. One is what these movements should demand. 
Many progressive economists talk about things like reregulating the banks and 
implementing a Tobin tax. However, as
explained above, we are unlikely to be able to impose these reformist measures
without the threat of something far more radical. And, knowing what happened the
last time the left settled for reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it, 
we should not be content merely to use socialism as a threat. This time we must
<em>implement</em> it.
Social democracy died in the 1980s and there is no point in trying to bring back
the dead. Rosa Luxemburg’s sentiments are more true now than ever: 
“Bourgeois society stands at the crossroads, either transition to Socialism or regression into Barbarism.”</p>
